<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>THE CROSS-COUNTRY RACE</small></h2>


<p>“This way, Hillton!”</p>

<p>In response ten boys dressed in white shirts bearing the
crimson H, white running pants, and spiked shoes disentangled
themselves from the crowd about the dressing-room
door and assembled at the corner of the grand stand. The
youth who had uttered the command was the captain of
the Hillton Academy Cross-country Team, and, with the
runners clustered close about him, he gave his last instructions
before the race in low and earnest tones:</p>

<p>“Fellows, we must win this, you know. It’s going to
be hard work; House and Beaming, of St. Eustace, are difficult
men to beat, but I think we can do it. Northrop
and I will try to attend to them. The rest of you must
try your best for the next places. I don’t believe there
is a dangerous runner in Shrewsburg’s team; at all events,
there aren’t four. If they get less than four in ahead of
us it won’t matter. Save yourselves for the last three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
quarters of a mile, and don’t try to leap the ‘combination
jump’ or the ‘Liverpool’; get over by the side railings
or run up the braces, as you’ve done in practice. It’s not
style over the obstacles that’s going to win this race, but
good hard running and lots of wind at the end. Keep
your strength till you need it most. Don’t try to get
ahead at the start; let the other fellow make the pace.
And right now, while I think of it, do try not to take off
too soon at the water jump. Moore, you try to remember
about that, will you? And be sure before you start that
your shoes are all right; it’s mighty tough work running
with a scraped heel, I can tell you. That’s all; only keep
yourselves moving, fellows, until the line-up.”</p>

<p>In obedience to the warning, shoes were looked after
again and the cotton wool stuffed carefully between them
and the ankles to preclude chafing, and the boys limbered
up their legs and kept the blood circulating by stepping
gingerly about the track on their toes—for all the world
like a band of Indians performing a war dance. Presently
the dressing-room door was flung open and twenty other
boys trotted out and followed the example of the Hillton
team. Of the twenty, ten bore on their sleeveless shirts
the blue monogram of St. Eustace and ten the great green
S of Shrewsburg High School. The distance judges had
already taken themselves off to their posts of duty about
the course, and the other officials were gathered in consultation
at the starting line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a bleak and cheerless Saturday afternoon. Overhead
leaden clouds hung low, and the fluttering red flags
that marked the course of the coming contest alone lent
color to the gray November landscape.</p>

<p>“Smells like snow, Wayne,” said the Hillton captain
to a runner who stood—or rather danced—beside him. “I
hope it won’t. The ground’s slippery enough now.”</p>

<p>“Rather wish it would, myself,” was the reply. “If
I could get decently stuck in a snow bank I’d like it a heap
better than finishing last in the race.”</p>

<p>“You won’t do that, you know. Lots of those Shrewsburg
chaps are slow men. I wish I was as certain that we’d
win the race as I am that you’ll finish well.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll do my best, Don, but you mustn’t expect
too much,” said the other boy anxiously. “I wouldn’t have
gone into it if you hadn’t said that it didn’t much matter
whether I came in first or last.”</p>

<p>“And it doesn’t; but I am certain, Wayne, that if you
try you can finish well up in the bunch. I think you’ve
got the making of a good runner. Of course, three weeks
of training—that is, the kind of training you’ve done”—the
other lad grinned—“doesn’t amount to a great deal
when it comes to a four-mile race. After the first round
pick some St. Eustace fellow and stick to him; you’ll be
surprised to find how much better it goes if some one is
making pace for you. By Jove! I do hope we can win to-day!
This is your first term, Wayne, and of course you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
don’t know how the fellows feel about it; but I tell you
we’d rather down St. Eustace than—than eat!”</p>

<p>“They won last year, didn’t they?”</p>

<p>“St. Eustace? Yes, that chap Beaming over there, the
little chap that looks like a fox terrier, came in first and
won the individual championship. Then House finished
next about three yards behind, and I got in ten yards or
so back of House. Then they got two more men in before
another Hillton runner was in sight. Oh, it was a regular
walk-over, Wayne. Come on, they’re ready.”</p>

<p>And Donald Cunningham and Wayne Gordon hurried
to the starting line. The former was a tall, lithe youth with
not an ounce of superfluous flesh over the firm muscles.
The pink hue of his bare arms and legs told of perfect
physical condition and his thin face showed energy and resolution.
His dark eyes—rather thoughtful eyes they were—had
a habit of looking very straight at you as he spoke,
and lent an expression of serious dignity to the countenance.</p>

<p>His companion was in appearance and temperament a
notable contrast. While scarcely an inch shorter than the
captain of the Cross-country Team, Wayne Gordon, by
reason of much unnecessary flesh, appeared lower in stature,
and lacked the fitness that comes of rigorous training. His
muscles, despite some spasmodic practice for the day’s
event, were still soft. While Donald’s face showed energy,
Wayne’s told of careless good humor and, especially about
the lower part, of pertinacity which might under certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
conditions develop into stubbornness. The eyes were brown,
frank, and honest, and at this moment were gazing before
him in smiling tensity.</p>

<p>The starter had cocked his pistol and the referee was
warning the runners as to the penalty for starting before
the signal. The onlookers, fully two hundred of them
in all, were assembled along both sides of the cinder
track, and were adding their voices to the referee’s, to the
total overwhelming of the latter. The runners were formed
in two lines across the track, their shoe spikes griping the
earth and their bodies poised forward.</p>

<p>“Has every one got his number?” asked the referee.
“Remember, the judges can’t register you if they don’t see
your numbers.”</p>

<p>Several fluttering papers were repinned to the white
shirts and the starter raised his voice.</p>

<p>“Are you ready?” A moment’s silence ensued.</p>

<p><em>Bang!</em> The pistol cracked sharply and the runners
swept in a bunch around the corner of the cinder track,
gained the turf, and headed toward where the red flags
indicated the first obstacle.</p>

<p>Of these obstacles the course held six, as follows: A
“Liverpool,” a “combination,” two hedge jumps, a bank
jump, and a water jump. The first consisted of a four-foot
dry ditch in front of a five-foot rail fence, followed, in turn,
by a broad and high hedge. The “combination” consisted
of a low bank surmounted by a two-foot hedge and followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
by a four-foot dry ditch. The hedge jumps differed only
in height, the first being three feet and the second three
feet six inches. The bank jump was four feet high. All
these were comparatively easy of surmountal in comparison
with the water jump. The hedges and bank might be
scrambled over, the “combination” could be fallen over—one
didn’t mind a few bruises—and the “Liverpool” could
be climbed over or surmounted by means of the fences on
either side or the stays which held up the rails. But the
water jump defied every method save a long, clean jump.
An eighteen-inch hedge was constructed on the bank of a
brook that came under the railway track and crossed the
golf course to the lake. The brook was here eight feet
broad and several feet deep in the middle, and constituted
a very pretty obstacle in the way of a youth tired out by
a one- or two-mile run and the conquest of all the lesser
obstacles. Only on the last round of the course was the
water jump omitted.</p>

<p>The distance to be run was four miles, or three times
around the course. Starting at the grand stand on the
campus the red flags guided the runners across the end of
the golf links near Home Hole, then bore away south along
the bank of the Hudson River, crossing the brook over the
little rustic bridge, and taking the railroad track at a right
angle between Railroad Bunker and Academy Hole. With
a short turn the course then swept back across the railway
again to the water jump, High and Track Bunkers, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
campus, the grand stand, and the yelling groups of spectators.</p>

<p>The plan of the course here reproduced was made by
Donald Cunningham for the use of the Cross-country Team,
and will, perhaps, aid the reader to a better understanding
of what follows. Paddy cast aspersions on this effort, but
Don was always very proud of it.</p>

<p>Each competing school entered a team of ten boys.
Points were apportioned according to the position of the
runners at the finish: thus, the first one completing the
three rounds of the course scored one; the second, two; the
third, three; and so on down to the last, only the leading
four in each team being considered. Besides a prize
for the winning team, a silver cup, the first runner in was
awarded the individual trophy, a bronze medal. Cross-country
running requires speed, strength, endurance, and
pluck—especially pluck. The course presents an infinite
variety of surface: slippery turf, loose gravel, mud, and
sometimes sand in which the feet sink to the ankles. Unlike
the ordinary running surface, the cross-country course
delights in inequality: a level width of turf is followed by
a sharp rise; a stretch of muddy road by a gully whose
steep sides require the utmost exertion from the panting
runner.</p>

<p>The course at Hillton was no exception; in fact, it was
more than usually severe. Besides the artificial obstacles—such
as the hedges, the bank, and the water jump—the railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
track, fenced on either side, and three golf bunkers
added their terrors to the race. To-day the ground, which
had been frozen hard the week before, was soft and treacherous
from the noonday thaw, and even spiked shoes found
slow and difficult going.</p>

<p>Six hundred yards from the start the field of runners
had spread out into three divisions. Fifty yards ahead
House and Beaming, the two St. Eustace cracks, led Donald
Cunningham by a stride, while close upon their heels ran
Moore, of Hillton, and two Shrewsburg boys. Back of them
came a little group of a dozen whose shirts showed the crimson
H, the blue monogram, and the green S in about equal
proportions. Farther to the rear the rest of the thirty struggled
and straggled along the course, already practically out
of the race so far as their effect on the final score was concerned.
At the “Liverpool” the St. Eustace leaders took
the ditch at a bound, gained the top of the fence, balanced
themselves a second, and cleared the hedge. The Hillton
captain and Moore used other tactics. Without lessening
his speed each planted one spiked toe on a brace that helped
to support the fence, gained the top bar in two strides, and
cleared the hedge. The Shrewsburg runners tried neither
of these styles, but climbed the fence, squirmed across the
hedge, and dropped helter-skelter to the ground, to find
themselves farther behind the four leaders. As each runner
surmounted the “Liverpool” the distance judges stationed
there registered his number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>From the grand stand every foot of the far-stretching
course was plainly in sight, and now the first men looked
like white specks as they took the turn, scrambled over the
second hedge jump, and headed toward home. Many of
the watchers deserted the finish line and clustered about
the water jump, loudly expressing the hope that some one
would “take a bath.” They climbed on to the fences that
led up to the obstacle and waited impatiently for the runners
to appear. Suddenly two white-clad figures were for
a moment seen sharply against the gray of the hills as they
took the railroad track in a bound; then they were climbing
the fence and speeding toward the watchers. Simultaneously
three others came into view, followed a moment
later by a fourth.</p>

<p>“Cunningham’s closed up!” cried the Hillton supporters
joyfully. “House has dropped back!”</p>

<p>The two captains of the rival teams bore down on the
jump, their faces flushed with exertion, but their legs moving
gracefully as they put yard after yard behind them.
Neither Beaming nor Cunningham slowed down perceptibly
at the hedge; each found the take-off at the same moment
and swept cleanly over the water side by side amid the
plaudits of the spectators. House, Moore, and a Shrewsburg
lad followed in the next minute, gained their applause,
and went on to the grand stand a dozen yards behind the
leaders. A second Shrewsburg runner, plainly in distress,
lessened his pace at the water jump, took off too soon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
landed knee-deep on the muddy margin of the brook. But
he was out in a moment and gained a hearty cheer by the
spirited spurt he made after the others.</p>

<p>Then the watchers had a moment of waiting ere the
next group of runners reached them. They came pouring
over the railroad track and fence by ones and twos, helter-skelter,
with a St. Eustace man a bare yard to the good
and a Hillton runner, Northrop, trying hard to reach him.
Over the hedge and water they went—the St. Eustace man,
Northrop, a Shrewsburg runner, another wearer of the blue
monogram, and another Shrewsburg boy—all clearing the
difficult jump in good style save the latter, who plumped
squarely into the middle of the brook, and so delighted the
watching lads that many of them fell from the fences in
sheer joy. Wayne Gordon came next and received a shower
of spray in his face as he cleared the brook and sped onward.
A St. Eustace boy followed the example of the unfortunate
Shrewsburg chap, and when the rest of the bunch
had passed the two crawled out and took up the running
once more with disgusted looks and spiritless gait.</p>

<p>By this time the leaders had reached a point across the
field and halfway around the second lap. Donald Cunningham
and Beaming, of St. Eustace, still fought for first
place, and House had left his Shrewsburg rival behind and
was close upon their heels, Moore, of Hillton, a few paces
off. Shrewsburg seemed out of the race. Her first two
men were now but a yard ahead of the leaders in the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
group, one still running easily and well, the other laboring
at every stride. Northrop managed to come up to the
third St. Eustace runner at the “combination jump,” and
by superior work over the obstacle drew several yards
ahead. Wayne Gordon moved up to the front rank of the
followers, and the race momentarily gained in interest to
the spectators.</p>

<p>Again the leaders made the turn at the far end of the
course and headed back toward the water jump, overtaking
several of the slower runners who were still struggling on
their first round. Cunningham, Beaming, and House were
practically side by side as they approached the jump, and
the cheers from the onlookers increased in volume. Beaming
spurted and took the leap in exhibition style, and Cunningham
and House took off almost ere he had set foot to
earth. The latter landed well and sped on, but the former,
to the consternation of the Hillton throng, while he cleared
the water, stumbled on the bank and dropped to his knees.
In an instant he had gained his feet and taken up the race
again, but his first stride proved to the dismayed supporters
of the crimson that he was out of the running. One—two—three
steps he took; then he swerved to the side of the
course, and would have fallen but for the ready arms that
were stretched toward him. He struggled from them.</p>

<p>“Let go, fellows,” he panted. “I’m all right; just—turned
my ankle.”</p>

<p>The boys drew back and he started on, limping woefully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
A dozen yards he traversed ere he gave up and threw himself
on the turf. A lad in disreputable football attire was
the first to reach him.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Don? Are you hurt?” he cried
anxiously.</p>

<p>There was no answer, and he leaned down and drew a
bare arm from before a face whereon the tears were trickling.</p>

<p>“Keep the fellows away, Paddy,” whispered Don
huskily. “I’ll—be all right—in a minute. I—I—my
ankle’s sprained, I guess; I can’t run—a step; and—and,
oh, Paddy, we’ve lost the race!”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>WHAT A LAUGH DID</small></h2>


<p>A few minutes later Don was sitting in a corner of the
grand stand, smothered in a pile of blankets and with his
injured ankle bound in wet bandages. Beside him were
two boys of about his own age, one of whom, the lad whom
he had addressed as Paddy, was solicitously slopping cold
water from a tin can over his ankle at frequent intervals.
Nothing serious, Professor Beck had decided, only a strained
tendon; and so Don had been helped to his present position,
from where he could watch the race run out. He looked
pale and woe-begone; but he managed to smile now and then
in answer to Paddy’s sallies.</p>

<p>“Paddy” Breen—his real name was Charles—had been
given his nickname two years before, when he was a little
red-headed junior too small to resent it had he been so inclined.
Paddy’s forbears had been Irish a generation or two
back, and although there was little about the boy to suggest
the fact, barring his red hair and gray eyes and sunny nature,
the name was somehow distinctly appropriate, and it
had stuck to him through his junior and lower middle years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and promised to stick forever. Paddy played center on
the first eleven, a position for which his broad shoulders
and hips and great strength eminently fitted him. To-day
he was attired in a faded and torn red sweater, a pair of
equally disreputable moleskin trousers, two red and black
striped stockings whose appearance told a story of many
battles, a pair of badly scuffed tan shoes, and a golf cap of
such bold and striking tones of brown, green, and scarlet
as to stamp it at once as brand-new.</p>

<p>The lad who sat on the other side of Don was of even
more generous build than Paddy Breen. Dave Merton’s
shoulders were broad and set well back, giving him a look
of great power. He was, perhaps, the least bit overgrown
for his seventeen years, for he topped Paddy by an inch
and Don by two. But he looked very healthy and happy,
and was as good-natured a fellow as any at the Academy.
His hair was black and his eyes dark, giving him a more
somber coloring than his bosom companion, Paddy, but, like
the latter, he preferred smiling to frowning. Dave had
two great ambitions in life at present—namely, to throw
the hammer farther than any other Hilltonian and to excel
at study. The latter seemed quite within the range of possibility,
but as for Dave’s hammer throwing it was a school
joke at which even Dave could laugh. Paddy Breen was a
brilliant pupil; Dave Merton a hard-working one. Paddy
was an excellent football player; Dave an indifferent performer
with the weights. Both were leaders in their classes—Dave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was a senior—and popular throughout the school.
Their friendship was as much a joke as Dave’s hammer
throwing and the two were inseparable.</p>

<p>“Beaten?” Paddy was saying scornfully. “Never, me
boy. Sure ’tis only beginning we are; just wait till we git
our breath!” Paddy, as though to lend indorsement to his
nickname, at times dropped into a brogue acquired with
great labor from such classics as Charles O’Malley and Tom
Burke.</p>

<p>“I only wish we had begun earlier in the race, Paddy,”
answered Don hopelessly. “Who is ahead in the bunch
there, Dave—can you make out?”</p>

<p>The leaders, House and Beaming, were now far up the
course and the next group of runners were some distance
behind. Farther back of them other contestants straggled.
Two runners were out of the race. A Shrewsburg boy had
given up on the second round and was philosophically watching
the contest from the top of a distant bank, and a Hillton
fellow, Turner, had gone to the dressing room suffering with
an attack of cramp. In answer to Don’s question Dave
studied the distant runners for a space in silence.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s Northrop in the lead all right, Don, and
the next two fellows are St. Eustace men. Then Moore
and a Shrewsburg chap, and another St. Eustace man, and—and
one of our team—I can’t make out who.” Dave
looked frowningly across the field.</p>

<p>“Which one?” asked Paddy. “The fellow with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
long legs just taking the hedge? Why, man, that’s Wayne,
of course; no mistaking him.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” answered Don. “He’s doing well. It
would be queer if he managed to keep his present place
and got in third, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Well, he won’t,” said Dave, “for Jones has passed
him. Good old Jones! Just look at him spurt!”</p>

<p>“Those two men just behind Northrop are Keller and
Gould, of St. Eustace,” said Don. “Well, I guess we’re
dished. House and Beaming are sure of first and second
place; Northrop ought to get third; then either Gould or
Keller is pretty certain to finish ahead of Moore—perhaps
both will; that would make the score something like twelve
to twenty-four, supposing we got three men in after Keller
and Gould.”</p>

<p>“There’s a good half mile to cover yet, my lad,” said
Paddy cheerfully. “There’s lots may happen in that distance.
Look there; those fellows are changing all around.
And, by Jove, fellows, look at Beaming!”</p>

<p>Beaming was dropping back and House was alone at
the turn of the course. And some one—it seemed as
though it <em>must</em> be Northrop, of Hillton—was closing up
the long gap between the leaders and the next group at a
fabulous pace. And even as the three boys on the grand
stand strained their sight a second runner left the group
as though it were standing still and shot after Northrop—if
it was Northrop. The runners were too far off to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
allow of the watchers being certain as to their identity,
but a look of hope crept into Don’s face. There seemed
nothing to do save wait until the runners appeared at the
railroad a third of a mile away, until Paddy spied a
pair of field glasses in the hands of a boy in the throng
below and unceremoniously gained possession of them. He
passed them to Don, and the latter, leaning for support on
Dave and Paddy, swept the course with them.</p>

<p>“Northrop’s ahead of Beaming!” he cried. “And
Jones is almost up to him! House is leading by forty yards
or more! A Shrewsburg fellow is running even with
Keller and Gould! Paddy, we’ve still got a show!”</p>

<p>“Where’s Wayne?” asked Dave.</p>

<p>“And Jones?” asked Paddy.</p>

<p>“Wayne? I—can’t—see him. Hold on; yes, there
he is! He’s at the back of the bunch; a Shrewsburg fellow’s
passing him hand over fist. Jones is gaining, Paddy;
he’s creeping up. There they go over the bank jump.
Some fellow’s done up—it’s Keller; Jones has passed him.”
Don excitedly turned his glasses toward a point nearer
home. “House still leads and is spurting, hang him!
Northrop’s fifty yards behind him, and Beaming—no, fellows,
it’s Moore! Moore’s in third place!”</p>

<p>“What?” cried Dave. “What’s up with Beaming?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know; he looks tuckered. Hello!”</p>

<p>“What is it, Don? Talk out; don’t be so plaguey
slow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“A Shrewsburg chap has gained fifth place and looks
as though he were going to beat Beaming in the next
twenty yards. What do you think of that? Jones and
Wayne are both gaining. By Jove, fellows, we may get
it yet! Let’s go down to the finish; help me down, Dave.”</p>

<p>“If only Jones and Wayne can last,” said Paddy, “we
could win, couldn’t we? But Wayne—” Paddy shook his
head as they descended from the stand and went toward
the finish line. “Do you think he can hold out, Don?”</p>

<p>Don shook his head dubiously.</p>

<p>At that moment Wayne was wondering the same thing.
He had surprised himself by staying in the race up to the
present moment. He had entered the contest only to oblige
Don. “I don’t ask you to hurt yourself,” the latter had
explained. “Drop out when you are tired. It will be
good practice and will save us from entering with only
nine fellows.” So Wayne had laughingly consented. As
he had passed runner after runner in the first two rounds
of the course he had begun to ask himself what it meant.
Don had told him that he had the making of a good long-distance
man, but he hadn’t given much heed to the statement;
apparently Don was right. After the first mile he
had begun to suffer a little, and now, with the race almost
over, he would like to have dropped out and spent about
ten minutes lying on his back, but it seemed a poor thing
to give up so near the end, and so he found himself still
pounding away, with his legs very stiff and his breath apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
about to fail him at every effort. He realized
that the ground had become softer and more slippery and
that snow was falling. Then he crossed the track and struggled
on toward the next obstacle, a three-and-a-half-foot
hedge.</p>

<p>Wayne hated the hedges. He was too heavy to hurdle
them well, and he invariably jumped short and lost precious
time getting his feet untangled. Luckily he was done with
that nightmare the water jump, since on the last round it
was avoided and the course led over the brook by the railroad
and thence straight down to the finish. As he approached
the hedge Wayne drew himself together for a
last effort, and at the take-off put all his strength into the
leap. But unfortunately the turf was bare at that spot
and his foot slipped as he jumped.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness!” he thought, when he had stopped
rolling. “Now I can lie here decently until the whole
thing’s over with!”</p>

<p>But his sensation of joyous relief was rudely dispelled.
Over the hedge leaped a boy with a blue monogram on
his shirt, who, as he caught sight of Wayne’s predicament,
grinned broadly. In a trice Wayne had struggled to his
feet and had taken up the chase race again, rage in his
heart.</p>

<p>“He laughed at me, hang him!” he panted. “I’ll just
beat him out if I die for it!”</p>

<p>The St. Eustace boy was several yards ahead already,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
but Wayne threw back his head and ran desperately. A
roar of voices from down the field told him that the first
man had finished. He put every ounce of strength into
the struggle, thinking nothing of who was winning, only
determined to beat the chap who had laughed at him. And
as he crossed the railroad the knowledge that he was gaining
on the St. Eustace runner brought joy to his heart.</p>

<p>Down at the finish line the air was filled with the cheers
of the St. Eustace supporters, who, though few in number,
were strong of voice. House had finished first and captured
the individual championship and prize. And now,
almost side by side, and struggling valiantly for second
place, came the two Hillton men, Northrop and Moore,
and the wearers of the crimson went wild with joy and
shouted until both runners had crossed the line, Northrop
in the lead, and had been led away to the dressing room.</p>

<p>Don was busy with pencil and paper now, while Paddy
looked over his shoulder and Dave scowled up the course
and waited impatiently for the next runner to swing into
sight around the corner of the little knoll that hid the railroad
track from the finish line. Then two white figures
broke into view almost simultaneously.</p>

<p>“A Shrewsburg fellow and a St. Eustace fellow!” cried
Dave. “I think the last is Beaming. Yes, it is!”</p>

<p>The runner with the green S won the line a good three
yards ahead of the almost breathless Beaming, and a little
group of Shrewsburg High School fellows broke into applause.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Beaming had to be well-nigh carried from the
course, although protesting faintly that he could walk.</p>

<p>Don’s paper now held the following figures:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="trackscores">
  <tr>
    <th class="tdcp">Hillton.</th>
    <th class="tdcp">St. Eustace.</th>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td class="tdcp">3</td>
    <td class="tdcp">5</td>
    <td class="tdcp"> </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>“Two men each and we’re one figure ahead,” whispered
Don. “There’s some one, Dave—three fellows. Who are
they?”</p>

<p>“St. Eustace fellow ahead,” answered Dave.</p>

<p>“It’s Gould!” cried a voice from near by, and the supporters
of the down-river academy cheered wildly.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” yelled Paddy. “Erin go bragh! There’s
good old Jones! And a Shrewsburg fellow hot after
him.”</p>

<p>Don tried to jump, but found he couldn’t because of his
strained ankle and contented himself with a hair-raising
yell. Then he added a 6 to the St. Eustace score, an
8 to that of Shrewsburg, and a 7 to Hillton’s row of
figures. For Gould, Jones, and the Shrewsburg runner
crossed the line in the order given amid the cheers of the
three rival contingents.</p>

<p>“It’s a tie so far,” shouted Paddy, as he added up the
few figures. “St. Eustace has twelve points, Dave, and so
have we. By Jove! it all depends on the next man, Don,
doesn’t it? Can you see any one, Dave?”</p>

<p>“No one in sight yet. Let’s hope the first will be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Hillton chap, fellows. But even if it isn’t the score’s bound
to be close. Wonder what’s become of ‘Old Virginia’?”</p>

<p>That was a nickname that Paddy had bestowed upon
Wayne Gordon in allusion to the latter’s native State.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid Wayne’s dropped out of it,” answered Don,
with a tremble in his voice, “but still——”</p>

<p>“St. Eustace wins!”</p>

<p>Half a dozen voices took up the cry as a fleet-footed
runner whose breast bore the blue monogram came quickly
into sight. The three boys groaned in unison. St. Eustace’s
fourth man was speeding toward the finish.</p>

<p>“Done for,” whispered Dave.</p>

<p>“Wait a bit!” cried Paddy. “There’s two of them
there. Who’s the second chap?”</p>

<p>Paddy was right. Directly behind the St. Eustace runner
sped a second youth, so close that he seemed to be treading
upon the former’s heels.</p>

<p>“It’s one of our fellows, Don!” cried Dave.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. I—oh, why doesn’t he come out so
that we can see!”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it’s another Shrewsburg chump,” said
Paddy dolefully. “Oh, hang the luck, anyhow!”</p>

<p>“Wait!” cried Don. “He’s coming out! There—there
he comes! He’s trying to pass, and—and——”</p>

<p>“It’s Wayne!” cried Dave and Paddy in unison.</p>

<p>And Wayne it was. Slowly, doggedly, he drew from
his place back of the St. Eustace man and fought his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
inch by inch alongside. The cheering spectators saw the
wearer of the blue glance swiftly at the Hillton runner
and throw back his head. But the boy beside him refused
to be thrown off and down the course they came together,
their tired limbs keeping time to the frenzied cheers of the
throng.</p>

<p>“St. Eustace wins! Keller’s ahead!”</p>

<p>“Hillton’s race! Gordon leads!”</p>

<p>And then, high above the babel of a hundred voices,
sounded a mighty shout from Paddy:</p>

<p>“Come on, ‘Old Virginia!’”</p>

<p>Wayne, racing along stride for stride with the St. Eustace
runner, heard the cry and made a final, despairing
effort.</p>

<p>And then the crowd was thick about him, Dave and
Paddy were holding him up, Don was hugging him ecstatically,
and the fellows were laughing and shouting as
though crazy; and Wayne, panting and weak, wondered
what it all meant.</p>

<p>It only meant that Hillton had won by a yard and that
the final score stood: Hillton, 21; St. Eustace, 22; Shrewsburg,
43.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>IN 15 BRADLEY</small></h2>


<p>It was getting dark in the study of No. 15 Bradley
Hall, and Wayne laid his book down on the window seat
and fell to looking idly out of the window. The broad expanse
of the Hudson River was visible for several miles,
and its quiet surface reflected all the tones of gold and
crimson with which the western sky was aglow. Far to
the left a little dark spot marked the location of the railway
station, and the steel rails, stretching to the southward,
caught the sunset glint here and there and looked
like shafts of fire. The meadow and the campus were still
green, and the station road was blotched with the purple
shadows of hedge and tree. To the left a tiny steamer was
creeping from sight beyond the island and the far-stretching
marsh across the water was brightly yellow with autumn
grass.</p>

<p>Inside the room the shadows were beginning to gather
wherever the glow from the two windows failed to reach.
They had already hidden the bookcase near the hall door
and Don’s armchair was only a formless hulk in the gloom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
The door to the bedroom was ajar and through it the
shadows were silently creeping, for that room was on the
back of the building and its one window gave but scant
light at sunset time. The study was a comfortable-looking
den. There was a big green-topped table in the center,
flanked by easy-chairs, and holding a student lamp, an
ornamental inkstand, a number of books, and a miscellaneous
litter of paper, pens, golf balls, gloves, and caps. A
lounge, rather humpy from long and hard usage, disputed
a corner of the apartment with a low bookcase whose top
afforded a repository for photographs and a couple of hideous
vases which for years past had “gone with the room.”
There was a fireplace on one side which to-day held no fire.
The mantel was decorated with more photographs and three
pewter mugs, Wayne’s trophies of the cinder track. Some
tennis racquets, three broken and repaired golf sticks, and
a riding whip were crossed in a bewildering fashion above
a picture of an English rowing regatta, and on either side
hung framed “shingles” of the Senior Debating Society
and the Hillton Academy Golf Club. Other pictures
adorned the walls here and there; two businesslike straight-backed
chairs were placed where they could not fail to be
fallen over in the dark; and a bright-colored but somewhat
threadbare carpet was on the floor. There were two
windows, for No. 15 was a corner study, and in each was
a comfortable seat generously furnished with pillows. At
this moment both seats were occupied. In one lounged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Wayne; in the other Don was still trying to study by the
fading light. His left foot was perched carefully on a
cushion, for the injured ankle was not yet fully strong,
although nearly a week had elapsed since the cross-country
run and his accident. Finally Don, too, laid aside his
book.</p>

<p>“Want to light up, Wayne?”</p>

<p>“No, let’s be lazy; it’s so jolly in the twilight. I like
to watch sunsets, don’t you? They’re sort of mysterious
and—and sad.”</p>

<p>“Hello!” laughed Don. “You must be a bit homesick.”</p>

<p>“No, not exactly, though the sunset did look a bit like
some we have down home. I wish you could see a Virginia
sunset, Don.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t they a good deal like any other sunset?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so. From our house at home the
sun always sets across a little valley and back of a hill with
a lot of dark trees on it. And there’s always a heap of
blue wood smoke in the air and the woods are kind of hazy,
you know. Wish I was there,” he added, with a tinge of
melancholy in his voice.</p>

<p>“Cheer up,” said Don. “You’ll feel better after
supper. You’re homesick. I used to be, my first year. Used
to think I’d give most anything for a sight of the Charles
River and the marshes, as they look from the library window
at home. But I got over it. When I began to feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
sad and virtuous I’d go out and swat a football or jump
over things. That’s the best way to get rid of homesickness,
Wayne; go in for athletics and get your blood running
right. You don’t have much chance to think about
home when you’re leaping hurdles or trying to bust your
own record for the hundred yards.”</p>

<p>“I should think not,” laughed Wayne. “I know I
wasn’t homesick the other day when I was chasing around
country and jumping over those silly hedges; but I reckon
I’d rather be a bit homesick than have my legs ache and
my lungs burst.”</p>

<p>“They won’t when you’re in training,” answered Don.
“But you did great work that day; we were awfully proud
of you.”</p>

<p>“So you say, and I suppose it’s all right, only I keep
telling you that I wasn’t trying to win the team race; I was
just trying to beat that blamed St. Eustace chump who
laughed at me when I was sitting comfortably on the
ground there. Just as though any fellow mightn’t fall over
those old hedges, hang him!”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you mind,” answered Don soothingly.
“He isn’t laughing now, you can bet; that laugh cost his
school the race.”</p>

<p>Wayne made no reply. He had gathered the pillows
in a heap under his head and was lying on his back nursing
his knees. It was almost dark outdoors and in the room
the shadows held full sway. Across from Don’s window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the lights in Masters Hall were coming out and throwing
dim shafts upon the broad gravel path.</p>

<p>“Wayne, I wish you’d go into training for the track
team,” continued Don. “All you need is some good hard
practice to make you a dandy runner. Why don’t you?”</p>

<p>“What’s the good?” asked Wayne carelessly. “I have
hard enough work as it is trying to learn my lessons without
losing a lot of time running around a track. Besides,
it’s so tiresome.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk nonsense,” answered Don. “You have
hard work with your lessons because you won’t study, and
you know it. You could do a lot of training in the time
you spend now in loafing. And, look here, Wayne, if you
go in for athletics you can study a lot better; really. I
know; I’ve tried both ways. And besides, you won’t have
to run around a track much until long after winter term
begins; hard work doesn’t start until February. Of course,
if you’ve made up your mind to be a duffer, I won’t say
anything more about it. But I’m captain of the track team,
and I know you would make a bully runner and I want you
to help me out if you will. We’re going to have a hard time
next spring to find good men for the mile and half-mile
events, and if we don’t win one of them I’m afraid St.
Eustace or Collegiate is sure of first place. I wish old
Hillton might come out on top next year. Think of it,
Wayne, this is my second year as captain, and my last, for
I shan’t take it again, and if we are beaten next spring it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
will be a nice record to leave behind, won’t it? Two defeats
and no victories! Hang it, we’ve got to win,
Wayne!”</p>

<p>Wayne laughed lazily.</p>

<p>“What’s so funny?” demanded Don rather crossly.</p>

<p>“You—you’re so serious. The idea of caring so much
about whether we get beaten or not next spring. Why,
it’s months away yet. If you’ve got to worry about it, why
not wait awhile?”</p>

<p>Don was too vexed to reply and Wayne went on in his
careless, good-natured tones.</p>

<p>“You fellows up North here are so crazy about athletics.
Of course, they’re good enough in their way, I reckon,
but seems to me that you don’t think about much else. I
don’t mean that you don’t study—you’re all awful grinds—but
you never have any time for—for——”</p>

<p>“What—loafing?” asked Don sarcastically.</p>

<p>“No, not exactly that, but—but—oh, hunting and riding
and being sociable generally. Do you shoot?”</p>

<p>“Not much; I’ve potted beach birds and plovers once
or twice.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the kind of sport I like. Down home we
shoot quail, you know; it’s right good fun. And next month
the fox hunting begins.”</p>

<p>“I think I should like that,” exclaimed Don eagerly,
forgetting his ill humor. “I’ve never ridden to hounds.
Isn’t it hard jumping fences and things?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hard—on a horse? Shucks! Compared to leaping
over hedges on your feet it’s about the easiest thing in the
world. All you have to do is to sit still.”</p>

<p>“Well, it sounds easy,” answered Don dubiously, “but
I should think sitting still on a horse that was plunging
over a rail fence would be rather difficult; seems to me
that the easiest thing would be to fall off. Did you ever
fall?”</p>

<p>“Twice. Once I hurt my shoulder a little. Of course
we boys don’t do any hard riding; dad won’t let me go
out very often, and when he does he always goes along.
You see, once I went fox hunting instead of going to school,
and he found out about it.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a school was it you went to?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a little private school kept by an old codger who
used to be a professor at the University. We fellows had
a pretty easy time of it; when we didn’t want to study we
didn’t, which was mighty often.”</p>

<p>“Well, you won’t find it so easy here,” said Don.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve found that out already,” answered Wayne
ruefully. “We have so many studies here I can’t begin
to keep track of them all. I never know whether I ought
to be at a recitation or fussing with dumb-bells in the gymnasium.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll get used to it after a while and like it
immensely, and think that there isn’t another place in the
world like Hillton. And when you do you’ll care more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
whether we win or get beaten at athletics and football; and
then——”</p>

<p>There came a loud hammering at the door.</p>

<p>“Enter Paddy and David!” cried Don.</p>

<p>Dave Merton alone entered, and closing the door behind
him promptly fell over an armchair.</p>

<p>“Confound you fellows! why can’t you keep your room
decent? A chap’s always breaking his shins when he comes
here. Where’s Paddy?”</p>

<p>“What, have you become separated?” cried Don.
“Light the gas, Wayne, and let us view the unaccustomed
sight of Dave without Paddy.”</p>

<p>“He said he was coming up here after he dressed.
I left him at the gym.” Dave stumbled against a
straight-backed chair, placed it on its back just inside
the door, and groped his way to a seat beside Don.
“Hope he’ll break his shins too, when he comes,” he said
grimly.</p>

<p>“What have you two inseparables been up to this afternoon?”
asked Don.</p>

<p>“Oh, Paddy’s been doing stunts with a football, and
he’s awfully annoyed over something, and I’ve been tossing
a hammer around the landscape; that’s all.”</p>

<p>“And did you manage to break another goal post?”</p>

<p>“No; couldn’t seem to hit anything to-day, although I
<em>did</em> come within a few yards of Greene.”</p>

<p>Another thunderous knocking was heard, and, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
awaiting an invitation, Paddy came in, and the sound of
breaking wood followed as he landed on the chair.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’ve bust something,” he said cheerfully, as
he struggled to his feet. “And serves you right, too. Is
Dave here?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t seen him,” answered Wayne.</p>

<p>“Wonder where the silly chump went to. Where are
you, you fellows?” Paddy felt his way around the table
and gropingly found a seat between Don and Dave. “He
said he was coming up here before supper.” A faint
chuckle aroused his suspicions and the sound of a struggle
followed. Then Paddy’s voice arose in triumphant tones.</p>

<p>“’Tis you, yer spalpeen. There’s only one ugly nose
like that in school.”</p>

<p>“Ouch!” yelled Dave. “Let go!”</p>

<p>“Is it you?” asked Paddy grimly.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Are you a spalpeen?”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh yes. Ouch!”</p>

<p>“All right.” Paddy deposited Dave on the floor and
arranged himself comfortably in the window.</p>

<p>“Dave says you’re annoyed, Paddy. Who’s been ill-treating
the poor little lad?” asked Don, when the laughter
had subsided and Dave had retreated to the other window
seat.</p>

<p>“Don, it’s kilt I am intoirely,” answered Paddy. “For
thirty mortal minutes Gardiner had me snapping back the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
ball to that butter-fingered Bowles. If he doesn’t put
another quarter-back in soon I shall hand in me resignation.
And to make things worse Gardiner stayed up all
last night and thought out a most wonderful new trick
play, and to-day he tried to put us through it. And, oh
dear! I wish you could have seen the backs all tearing
around like pigs with a dog after them, bumping into each
other, getting in each other’s way and all striking the line
at different places and asking, please wouldn’t we let them
through! Oh dear! oh dear! And that chap Moore, who
plays center on the second, got me around the neck twice
and tried to pull my head off. If he doesn’t quit that trick
I’ll be forced to forget my elegant manners and slug him.”</p>

<p>“And he’ll wipe the turf up with you, and I hope he
does,” said Dave, rubbing his nose ruefully.</p>

<p>“And the St. Eustace game only two weeks off,” continued
Paddy, heedless of the interruption. “We’re in an
awful state, fellows. I wish we had Remsen back to coach
us. Gardiner’s all right in his way, but he doesn’t begin
to know the football that Stephen Remsen does. We’re
goners this year for sure.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cheer up,” answered Don. “You can do lots in
two weeks. Look at the material we’ve got.”</p>

<p>“Yes, look at it,” said Paddy. “There isn’t a man in
the line or back of it that’s played in a big game except
Greene and myself.”</p>

<p>“But St. Eustace has a lot of new men this year, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it, my boy. That’s what they say,
but Gardiner told me yesterday that St. Eustace has five
fellows on the team that played against us last year.”</p>

<p>“Does the game come off here?” asked Wayne.</p>

<p>“No, it’s at Marshall this year. We’re all going down,
aren’t we, fellows?” asked Dave.</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Don. “We will go and see
Paddy slaughtered. Wayne will go along and we’ll teach
him to sing ‘Hilltonians.’ By the way, I’ve been trying
to persuade him that he ought to take up training for the
track team. He will make a first-class runner. But he’s
so terribly lazy and indifferent that it’s like talking to a
football dummy.”</p>

<p>“Of course you ought to, Wayne,” exclaimed Paddy
earnestly. “It’s your duty, my young friend. Every fellow
ought to do everything he can for the success of the
school. I’d try for the team if I could run any faster than
I can walk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” said Wayne, “I’ll see about it.”</p>

<p>“You ought to jump at the chance,” said Dave, in disgust.
“It isn’t every chap that gets asked by the captain
of the team. And, let me tell you— Hello! Six o’clock,
fellows. Who’s for supper?”</p>

<p>“Every one,” cried Don, jumping up. “But I’ve got
to wash first. Some one light the gas if they can find the
matches.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m off,” said Paddy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“So’m I,” echoed Dave. “I say, Don, I’m coming
over after supper to see if you can help me with that trigonometry
stuff.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Don from the bedroom between
splashes. “If you know less about it than I do I’ll be surprised.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” cried Paddy impatiently from the doorway—</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>THE REVOLT BEGINS</small></h2>


<p>Wayne lounged down the steps of the Academy Building,
a little bundle of books under his arm, and listlessly
crossed the grass to the wall that guarded the river bluff,
from where an enticing panorama of stream and meadow
and distant mountains lay before him. The day was one
of those unseasonably warm ones which sometimes creep
unexpectedly into the month of November, and which make
every task doubly hard and any sort of idleness attractive.
The river was intensely blue, the sky almost cloudless, and
the afternoon sun shone with mellow warmth on the deep
red bricks of the ancient buildings.</p>

<p>Wayne tossed his books on the sod and perched himself
on the top of the wall. The last recitation of the day
was over and he was at a loss for something to do. To be
sure, he might, in fact ought to study; but study didn’t
appeal to him. Now and then he turned his head toward
the building in hope of seeing some fellow who could be
induced to come and talk with him. Don was doing laboratory
work in physics and Dave and Paddy were undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
on the campus. At a little distance a couple of boys
whom Wayne did not know were passing a football back and
forth as they loitered along the path. A boy whom he did
know ran down the steps and shouted a salutation to him,
but Wayne only waved his hand in reply. It was Ferguson,
who talked of nothing but postage stamps, and Wayne had
outgrown stamps and found no interest in discussing them.
Ferguson went on around the corner of Academy Building
toward the gymnasium, and with a start Wayne recollected
that at that moment he should be making one of a
squad of upper middle-class fellows and exercising with the
chest weights. He looked doubtfully toward the point
where Ferguson had disappeared. What right, he asked
himself, had a preparatory school, where a fellow goes to
learn Greek and Latin and mathematics, and such things,
to insist that a fellow shall develop his muscles with chest
weights and dumb-bells and single sticks? None at all; the
whole thing was manifestly unjust. Schools were to make
scholars and not athletes, said Wayne, and he, for one, stood
ready to protest, to the principal himself if need be, against
the mistaken system.</p>

<p>The moment for such protest must be drawing near,
thought the boy, with something between a grin and a scowl,
for he had already twice absented himself from gymnasium
work, and only yesterday a polite but firm note
from Professor Beck had reminded him of the fact. Well,
he was in for it now, and he might as well be hung for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
sheep as a lamb. He gathered his books together and
started along the river path toward the campus in search
of Paddy or Dave. He wanted to tell some one about it.</p>

<p>Wayne had been at Hillton two months, and was apparently
no nearer being reconciled to the discipline and
spirit of the Academy than on the day he entered. He
found the studies many and difficult and the rules onerous.
Everything was so different from what he had been accustomed
to. At home he had attended a small private school
where laxity of discipline and indifference to study occasioned
but scant comment. The dozen or so scholars studied
practically what they pleased and when they pleased,
which in many cases was very little. Wayne’s mother had
died when he was five years of age; his father, who had
labored conscientiously at the boy’s upbringing, had erred
on the side of leniency. Wayne had been given most everything
for which he had asked, including his own way on
many occasions when a denial would have worked better results.
A boy with less inherent manliness might have been
spoiled beyond repair. Wayne was—well, perhaps half
spoiled; at all events unfitted for his sudden transition to a
school like Hillton, where every boy was thrown entirely
on his own resources and was judged by his individual accomplishments.</p>

<p>Wayne envied Don and Paddy, and even Dave, their
ability to conquer lessons with apparent ease. He was not
lazy, but was lacking in a very valuable thing called application,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
which is sometimes better than brains. And where
Don mastered a lesson in thirty minutes Wayne spent twice
that time on a like task. It had required two months of
the hardest coaching to fit Wayne for admission into the
upper middle class at the Academy, and now he was making
a sad muddle of his studies and was beginning to get discouraged.
He wished his father hadn’t sent him to Hillton;
or, rather, he would wish that were it not for Don—and
Paddy—and Dave—and, yes, for lots of other things.
Wayne sighed as he thought of what a jolly place the
Academy would be if it wasn’t for lessons—and chest
weights! And this brought him back to his grievance, and,
having reached the campus, he looked about to find some
one to whom he might confide his perplexities and resolves.</p>

<p>But both Paddy and Dave were too busy to heed any
one else’s troubles. Paddy, in a disreputable suit of football
togs, his face streaming with perspiration, was being
pushed and shoved about the gridiron, the center of a writhing
mass of players, while the coach’s whistle vainly proclaimed
the ball not in play. Dave, his good-natured face
red with exertion, was struggling with his beloved hammer
amid a little circle of attentive and facetious spectators.</p>

<p>“Say, Dave, you ought to stop, really you had,” one of
the onlookers was saying as Wayne joined the circle. “If
you keep at it much longer you won’t be able to throw that
thing out of the circle.”</p>

<p>“Three feet four inches short of the first mark,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a youth with a tape as he rose from measuring the last
flight of the weight. “Better rest a bit.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you take the hammer off, Dave, and throw
the handle?” asked a third boy.</p>

<p>“Well, I wish you’d step up here and have a try at it,”
answered Dave good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’m not a strong man like you. If I was half
as big I’d throw the old thing twice as far as that.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps you’ll grow in time, Tommy. Hello,
Wayne,” he continued, as he caught sight of that youth,
“why don’t you say something funny? I don’t mind;
go on.”</p>

<p>“Can’t think of anything right now,” answered
Wayne. “The funniest thing I know of is tossing an iron
ball around when it’s too warm to move. You look like
a roast of beef, Dave.”</p>

<p>“Do I? Well, I’ve been roasted enough; I’m going
to knock off. Besides, I’m in poor form to-day. Let’s go
over and watch Paddy, poor dub. I guess he’s having a
hard time of it, too.”</p>

<p>Dave picked up his sweater and hammer and the two
strolled over to the side-line and sat down. The first and
second elevens, the latter augmented by several extra players,
were putting in a hard practice. Less than a fortnight
remained ere the game of the season would be played with
St. Eustace Academy, and hard work was the order of the
day. The head coach, an old Hillton graduate named Gardiner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
was far from satisfied with the team’s showing. As
Paddy had pointed out, he and Greene were the only members
of the first eleven who had the experience that participation
in a big game brings. Greene was the captain
and played right end, and to-day he was visibly worried
and nervous, and was rapidly working his men into much
the same state when Gardiner called time and allowed the
almost breathless players to strew themselves over the field
on their backs and pant away to their heart’s content.
Paddy caught sight of the two boys on the side-line and
crawled dejectedly over to them on all fours, his tongue
hanging out, in ludicrous imitation of a dog.</p>

<p>“It’s awful, my brethren, simply awful. We are probably
the worst lot of football players in the world. Greene
will tell you so—and glad of the chance, bad luck to him!
He’s got the ‘springums.’”</p>

<p>“What are those?” asked Wayne.</p>

<p>“Oh, those are nerves; when you can’t keep still, you
know. That’s what’s the matter with Greene to-day. And
I don’t much blame him; the weather’s unfit for practice,
and every chap on the team feels like a sausage, and the
St. Eustace game’s a week from Thursday. I heard March
tell Gardiner——”</p>

<p>“Is Joel March here?” asked Dave.</p>

<p>“Yes; see him over there talking to ‘Pigeon’ Wallace?
He said to Gardiner a few minutes ago, ‘There’s
one great trouble with that eleven, Mr. Gardiner, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
is that it’s not the kind that wins.’ He didn’t know I could
hear. Of course I wouldn’t tell Greene for a house and
farm. But March is right; I’ve felt that way all the fall.
And if March says we can’t win, we’re not going to.”
Paddy sighed dolefully.</p>

<p>“Tommyrot, Paddy!” answered Dave. “Joel March
isn’t infallible, and the team may take a big brace before
Thanksgiving.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Joel March, anyway?” asked Wayne.</p>

<p>“Joel March? Why, Joel March is—is— Say, haven’t
you ever heard of March?” exclaimed Dave, in deep disgust.
Wayne shook his head.</p>

<p>“I reckon not; if I have I’ve forgotten it. What did
he do—run a mile in eighteen and three-fourth seconds or
throw an iron ball over Academy Building?”</p>

<p>“Neither, my sarcastic and ignorant young friend from
the Sunny South,” answered Paddy, with asperity. “But
he’s the finest half-back in college; and if you knew anything
about the important affairs of the day you would
know that he made the only score in the Harwell-Pennsylvania
game last Saturday, and that he ran over fifty-five
yards to do it! Also, and likewise, and moreover,” continued
Paddy, with great severity, “when I was a little
green junior, two years ago, I sat just about here and
watched Joel March kick a goal from the field that tied
the St. Eustace game after they had us beaten. And I
yelled myself hoarse and couldn’t speak loud enough at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
dinner to ask for the turkey, and Dave ate my share before
my eyes! That’s who Joel March is.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say,” responded Wayne, without displaying
the least bit of awe. “And who’s the swell with him?”</p>

<p>“That’s West, his chum. West is the father of golf
here at Hillton,” answered Dave, with becoming reverence.
“I used to follow him when he went around and wish that
I could drive the way he could. He was a member of the
team that Harwell sent to the intercollegiate tournament
last month. Is March going to coach the backs, Paddy?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know; but they could stand it. There’s going
to be a shake-up next half, I’ll bet. Gardiner says if the
second scores on us again before Thanksgiving he’ll send
it to Marshall instead of the first. Gardiner’s a great jollier.
Here we go again like lambs to the slaughter,” added
Paddy as the whistle blew.</p>

<p>“You remind me of a lamb,” said Dave; “you’re so
different.”</p>

<p>Paddy playfully pommeled the other’s ribs and then
cantered off to the center of the gridiron, where Gardiner,
Greene, and March, the old Hillton half-back, were assembled
in deep converse.</p>

<p>“Want to go back,” asked Dave, “or shall we stay
and see the rest of the practice?”</p>

<p>“Let’s stay,” said Wayne. “I suppose Paddy is sure
of his place, isn’t he? I mean they won’t put him off,
will they?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>“No; I guess Paddy’s all right for center. But the
big chap next to him, at left-guard, is sure to go on the
second, I think. They ought to have made Paddy captain
last fall. Greene’s an awfully decent fellow, but he’s liable
to get what Paddy calls the ‘springums.’ He’s too high-strung
for the place. Watch Gardiner now; he’s doing
things.”</p>

<p>The head coach was a big, broad-shouldered man, with a
face so freckled and homely as to be attractive. Many
years before he had been a guard on the Hillton eleven
and his name stood high on the Academy’s roll of honor.
As Dave had said, he was “doing things.” Four of the
first eleven players were relegated in disgrace to the ranks
of the second, their positions being filled by so many happy
youths from the opposing team. Wayne noted with satisfaction
that Paddy’s broad bulk still remained in the center
of the first eleven’s line when the two teams faced each
other for the last twenty minutes of play. Joel March,
with coat and vest discarded, took up a position behind
quarter-back and from there coached the two halfs with
much hand-clapping and many cheery commands. Greene
appeared to have recovered his equanimity, and the first
eleven successfully withstood the onslaught of the opponents
until the ball went to Paddy and a spirited advance down
the field brought the pigskin to the second’s forty-yard line
and gave Grow, the full-back, an opportunity to try a goal
from a placement. The attempt failed and the ball went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
back to the second, but the first’s line again held well, and
a kick up the field sent the players scurrying to the thirty-five-yard
line, where, coached by March, Grow secured the
ball and recovered ten yards ere he was downed. Later
the first worked the ball over for a touch-down, from which
no goal was tried, and the practice game ended without
the dreaded scoring by the second eleven, much to Paddy’s
relief.</p>

<p>The three boys hurried back together, and Wayne, parting
from his companions at the gymnasium, sought his room,
reflecting on the athletic mania that seemed to possess every
fellow at the school.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to do something that way myself,” he
thought ruefully, “or I’ll be a sort of—what-yer-call-it?—social
outcast.”</p>

<p>Then he recollected that he had forgotten to consult
Dave regarding his proposed declaration of right, and was
rather glad that he had; because, after all, he told himself,
Dave Merton was not a chap that would sympathize with
a protest against gymnastics and such things. But that
evening, as the two sat studying in their room after supper,
Wayne told his plans to Don and asked for an opinion.
And Don looked up from his Greek text-book and said
briefly and succinctly:</p>

<p>“Don’t do it!”</p>

<p>“But, I say, Don, I’ve got some voice in the business,
haven’t I? What right has Professor Beck or Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Wheeler or—or any of them got to make me develop my
muscles if I don’t want my muscles developed? When it
comes to study, you know, why, that’s another——”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’ll take my advice you’ll stop worrying
about your rights and obey the rules.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“Because if you don’t, Wayne, you’d much better have
stayed at home. I—I tried asserting my rights once and
it didn’t pay. And since then I’ve tended to my own affairs
and let the faculty make the laws.”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” answered Wayne, with immense dignity,
“I don’t intend to put up with injustice, although
you may. I shall tell Professor Wheeler just what I’ve
told you, and——”</p>

<p>Don looked up from his book with a frown.</p>

<p>“Wayne, <em>will</em> you shut up?”</p>

<p>“But I’m telling you——”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to hear. It’s all nonsense. And,
besides, if you’re going to say it all to ‘Wheels’ what’s
the good of boring me with it? Talk about injustice,”
groaned Don, “look at the length of this lesson!”</p>

<p>Wayne opened his book and, as a silent protest against
his friend’s heartlessness, began to study.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>PRINCIPAL AND PRINCIPLES</small></h2>


<p>Wayne’s opportunity to protest came earlier than he
expected. When he entered Bradley Hall in the middle
of the forenoon to get his French grammar he found an
official-looking note in the mail box. It proved to be from
the principal and requested Wayne’s presence at the office
at noon. The latter made hard work of the French recitation,
and took no interest in the doings of Bonaparte in
Egypt for thinking of the approaching interview and
strengthening the arguments which were to confuse the
principal and put the iniquitous school law to rout.</p>

<p>He found the principal’s secretary and two pupils, who
assisted in the work, occupying the outer office. Professor
Wheeler was engaged, but would see him in a moment.
Wayne took a chair, resenting the delay which required him
to nurse the state of virtuous indignation into which he had
worked himself. The quiet of the room, disturbed only by
the scratching of the pens or the rustling of paper, presently
exerted a depressing effect, and he felt his courage oozing
out of him. Then the secretary arose and went into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
inner room. When he returned a moment later he left
the door ajar and Wayne caught a glimpse of a warm-toned
apartment, a portion of a high bookcase, and the corner of a
broad mahogany desk. From within came a slight shuffling
of uneasy feet and the noise of a turned page. Then came
the sound of a closing book, and a voice, which Wayne
recognized as belonging to the principal, broke the silence:</p>

<p>“Now, my boy, I’ll speak with you. What is your
name?”</p>

<p>“Carl Gray, sir,” answered a very boyish voice.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; you’re in the lower middle class?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“I have received a complaint from Porter, in the village.
He informs me that you have owed him a bill since
last term and that he can not get his money. Is that
true?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” The boy spoke in low tones, and Wayne,
without seeing him, knew the state of trepidation he was
in and wondered if he would behave so cravenly when his
turn came.</p>

<p>“You knew the rule about such things?” asked the
principal. “You knew that pupils are not allowed to contract
debts?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then why did you do it, Gray?”</p>

<p>“I—I wanted some things, and so— Porter said that
he would trust me——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let me see. You played on one of the nines last
spring, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; on the junior class nine.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Well, Gray, when you knock a good clean base
hit what do you do? Do you run over toward the grand
stand and then back toward the pitcher’s box and so on to
first base, or do you go there as directly and as speedily as
you know how?” A moment of silence followed and
Wayne grinned.</p>

<p>“Directly, sir,” said the boy inside finally.</p>

<p>“Yes, I should think so. Well, now, when you start to
make an explanation apply the same rule, my lad: go just
as directly and quickly as you can to the point. As a
matter of fact, you knew that you were disobeying the
rules of the Academy, and preferred to do that than to go
without some things that you wanted. Isn’t that so?”</p>

<p>“I— No, sir, I didn’t——”</p>

<p>“That isn’t just the way you would put it, Gray, but
isn’t it correct?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“Do you have an allowance, Gray?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; fifty cents a week.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t find it large enough?”</p>

<p>“I wanted some baseball things and some clothes. We
had to have uniforms.”</p>

<p>“I see. Did you think when you had the things charged
to you that you could pay for them?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I meant to pay a quarter every week, but
somehow, sir——”</p>

<p>“The quarter wasn’t there when you wanted it; I see.
Well, Porter must be paid. He is not blameless in the
affair; he knew what the rule is about giving credit to the
pupils, and I shall see that he gets no more of the school
trade. But that doesn’t alter the fact that you owe him
the sum of twelve dollars. Can you pay it?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not right away. I will pay him fifty cents a
week. I offered to do so a week ago and he said he must
have the whole amount, and I was saving it up.”</p>

<p>“H’m! How much have you saved?”</p>

<p>“A—a dollar.”</p>

<p>“Slow work, Gray. Now, I shall settle this bill and
send the account to your parents. Have you anything to
say about that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, please don’t! I’ll pay it as soon as I can,
sir; I will give him every cent I get. Only please don’t
send it home!”</p>

<p>“Your family is not well off, Gray?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I have only a mother, and she couldn’t pay
it without—without missing the money dreadfully, sir. If
only you will not let her know!”</p>

<p>“You should have thought of that before, Gray. I
should like to spare your mother as much, perhaps, as you;
but the rules are strict and I can’t see my way to making
an exception in your case. I shall have to send the bill to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
your mother, sir. Let it teach you a lesson. There are
lots of things in this world, Gray, that we think we must
have, but which we can do very well without if only we
realize it. It is hard sometimes to see others possess things
that we want and can not have. But luckily the world
doesn’t judge us by our possessions, but by our accomplishments.
I don’t believe that the football clothes which you
got from Porter enabled you to play better ball or stand
better in your class, and it’s very unlikely that any of the
boys thought you a finer fellow for having them. In future
live within your income—that is, your allowance—and if
you want to pay off the debt save your money instead of
spending it, and when the amount is saved return it to your
mother. That would be an honest and a manly act. That
is all I have to say to you, my boy.”</p>

<p>“I will, sir,” answered the culprit earnestly. “But
won’t you—couldn’t you please, sir, not send——”</p>

<p>“That can’t be altered, Gray,” answered the principal
kindly. “I am sorry. Good day.”</p>

<p>A slender and very white-faced boy passed out with
averted eyes, and a moment later Wayne found himself in
the inner office. The principal was leaning back in his big
armchair thoughtfully polishing his glasses. He did not
look up at once, and Wayne had an opportunity to study
the man who for over twenty years had wisely directed the
affairs of one of the largest preparatory schools of the country,
and who in that time had gained the reverence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
affection of thousands of boys. Wayne saw a middle-aged,
scholarly looking man, whose brown hair was but lightly
frosted about the temples, and whose upright and vigorous
figure indicated the possession of much physical
strength. There was an almost youthful set to the broad
shoulders, and Wayne was certain that the muscles won
years before in his college crew were still firm and strong.
Indeed, those muscles, although Wayne did not know it,
were kept in perfect condition by as much bodily exercise
as the principal could crowd into a busy life, and his
prowess with a golf club was a matter of pride and admiration
among the boys. There was a kindly look in the brown
eyes that were presently turned upon the waiting lad.</p>

<p>“Are you Wayne Gordon?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You’re in the upper middle, aren’t you, and this is
your first year at Hillton?”</p>

<p>Wayne again assented.</p>

<p>“And I dare say you are not perfectly acquainted with
the rules of the Academy yet; I can understand that. It
takes some time to learn them, even though we try not to
have very many. Professor Beck tells me, Gordon, that
you have been absent on three occasions from gymnasium
work and have failed to make any excuse. I presume you
had some very good reason for not attending on each occasion,
did you not?” The tone and manner were so kindly
that Wayne found himself wishing that he had some presentable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
excuse; but in the next moment he remembered
his purpose and answered uncompromisingly:</p>

<p>“I stayed away on three days, sir, because it was not
convenient to attend. I don’t consider that you—I mean
the faculty—has any right to compel a fellow to—to do
gymnasium work unless he wishes to.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” was the quiet reply. “And how do you
arrive at that conclusion?”</p>

<p>Whereupon Wayne very earnestly and at much length
presented his views on the subject, maintaining a respectful
but undoubtedly rather irritating tone of complacency.
Once or twice the listener frowned, once he smiled, as
though in spite of himself, at some high-sounding phrase
from the boy. When Wayne had finished, a little breathless,
the principal spoke:</p>

<p>“Are you a member of the debating club, Gordon?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Wayne, surprised into an expression
of ordinary curiosity quite unbecoming a great reformer.</p>

<p>“You should join. I think you have the making of a
very lucid and convincing speaker.” The boy strove to
detect an expression of irony on the master’s face, but saw
none. “Unfortunately, in the present case you have
selected a side in the debate that is not defensible. And,
also unfortunately, I have neither the time nor the inclination
to enter the lists with you. But I will say one or
two things on the subject. In the first place, it is a waste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of your time to consider whether or not the faculty has the
right to make the rule regarding physical training; the indisputable
fact is that the faculty has made the rule. For
the sake of argument—although I said I would not argue—let
us assume that the faculty has not the right. What
can you do about it? The rules are not altered, after ten
years, on the demand of one scholar out of a school of some
two hundred. If the pupil stands firm and the faculty
stands firm what is going to be the result? Why, the two
must part company. In other words, the pupil must leave.
Do you think it is worth it?”</p>

<p>“But it’s wrong, sir, and if I accept the—the arrangement
I am indorsing it, and I can’t do that.”</p>

<p>“But maybe it isn’t wrong; we only assumed it to be,
you remember. You don’t care for athletics?”</p>

<p>“Not much, sir; I like riding and shooting and fishing,
but I don’t see the good of fussing—I mean exercising—with
dumb-bells and chest weights and single sticks; and it
tires me so that I can’t do my lessons well.” The principal
raised his eyebrows in genuine astonishment.</p>

<p>“Are you certain of that? Maybe you have not given
the thing a fair trial. We believe here at Hillton that it
is just as necessary to keep a boy’s health good as his morals,
and our plan has worked admirably for many years. The
rule regarding ‘compulsory physical education,’ as you
call it, is not peculiar to Hillton; it is to be found at every
preparatory school in the country, I feel sure. A capability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
for good studying depends on a clear brain and a well body,
and these, in turn, depend on a proper attention to exercise
and recreation. The first of these we demand; the other
we encourage and expect. Who is your roommate?”</p>

<p>“Donald Cunningham, sir.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! And does he have very much trouble with
his studies?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; but he has been at it for two years—the gymnasium
work, I mean. I’m not used to it, and I find the
studies difficult, and if I am tired I can’t do them.”</p>

<p>“If gymnasium work tires you it is undoubtedly because
you have not had enough of it. And it shows that
you need it. Professor Beck is very careful to require no
more in that direction from a boy than his condition should
allow, and to render mistakes impossible the physical examination
of every pupil is made when he enters, and again
at intervals until he leaves school. Now, I will speak to
Professor Beck; maybe it will seem advisable to him to
make your exercise a little lighter for a while. But I expect
you to report regularly at the gymnasium, or, if you
are feeling unfit, to tell me of the fact. We won’t require
any boy to do anything that might be of injury to him.
Will you promise to do this?”</p>

<p>“I can’t, sir. It is the principle of the thing that is
wrong.”</p>

<p>“I can’t discuss that with you any longer, Gordon; I’ve
done so at greater length than I intended to already. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
must obey the rules while you are here. If you do not you
must go elsewhere. When is your next gymnasium day?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow, sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well; I shall expect you to be there. If you are
not I shall be obliged to put you on probation, which is a
very uncomfortable thing. If you still refuse you will be
suspended. I tell you this now so that you may labor under
no illusions. I do not complain because you hold the views
which you do—they are surprising, but not against discipline—but
I must and do insist that you obey the rules.
Think it over, Gordon, and don’t do yourself an injury by
taking the wrong course. If you want to see me in the
morning, after you have slept on the matter, you will find
me here. Good day.”</p>

<p>“Good day, sir, and thank you for your advice;
only——”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I can do as you wish.”</p>

<p>“But,” answered the principal earnestly, “let us hope
that you can.”</p>

<p>“I want two dollars, Don.”</p>

<p>Don glanced up with a smile.</p>

<p>“So do I; I was thinking so just this morning. I need
a new pair of gymnasium shoes, and— But please, Wayne,
come in and shut the door; there’s a regular cyclone blowing
around my feet.”</p>

<p>“But, look here. I want to borrow two dollars from
you, Don; I must have it right away,” said Wayne peremptorily,
as he shut out the draught.</p>

<p>“Sorry, because I haven’t got fifty cents to my name,
and won’t have until Monday. What do you want to do
with it? Going to start a bank?”</p>

<p>“That’s none of your business,” answered Wayne;
“and if you can’t lend it to me I can’t stop chinning here.
I’ll try Paddy, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Paddy!” exclaimed Don, with a grin. “Why, Paddy
never has a nickel ten minutes after his dad sends him
his allowance, which is the first. If he had I’d be after
him this minute; he’s owed me eighty cents ever since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
September. Dave might have it. Have you had dinner?
Where did you go to?”</p>

<p>“Dinner? No, I forgot about it. What time is it?
Am I too late?”</p>

<p>“Of course; it’s twenty after two. What have you
been doing?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve—” Wayne’s face grew cloudy as he
jumped off the end of the table and went to the door.
“I’ll tell you about it later. I’m busy now. Has Dave
got a recitation on?”</p>

<p>“What’s to-day—Thursday? I’m sure I don’t know.
I never can keep track of his hours; seniors are such an
erratic, self-important lot.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll run over and see. Er—by the way, do
you know a chap called Gray, a rather pasty-looking lower
middle fellow?”</p>

<p>“Gray? No, I don’t think so. What does he
do?”</p>

<p>“Do? Oh, I think he’s a baseball player, or something
like that.”</p>

<p>“Don’t remember him. Are you coming up here
after four?”</p>

<p>“Yep; wait for me.”</p>

<p>Wayne clattered off downstairs and crossed the green
back of the gymnasium and the principal’s residence. As
he went he drew a little roll of money from his vest, supplemented
it with a few coins from his trousers’ pocket,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and counted the whole over twice. He shook his head as
he put the money away again.</p>

<p>“Nine dollars and forty-two cents,” he muttered,
“and I can’t make any more of it if I count it all day.”</p>

<p>He ran up the steps to Hampton House, pushed open
the broad, white door and entered the big colonial hallway.
At the far end a cheerful fire was cracking in a generous
chimney place, lighting up the dim gilt frames and
dull canvases of the portraits of bygone Hilltonians that
looked severely down from the walls. Hampton House is
a dormitory whose half dozen rooms are inhabited by a
few wealthy youths who find in the comfort of the great,
old-fashioned apartments and the prestige that residence
therein brings compensation for the high rents. Wayne
turned sharply to the right and beat a tattoo with his
knuckles over the black figure 2 on the door. From within
came the sound of a loud voice in monotonous declamation.
Wayne substituted his shoe for his knuckles and Paddy’s
voice bade him enter.</p>

<p>“Where’s Dave?” asked Wayne. Paddy, who had
been tramping up and down the apartment with a book
in his hand, and declaiming pages of Cæsar’s Civil War to
the chandelier, tossed the volume aside and tried to smooth
down his hair, which was standing up in tumbled heaps,
making him look not unlike “the fretful porcupine.”</p>

<p>“Dave’s at a recitation; German, I think. Want to
see him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I want to borrow some money from him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think he has any. You see, I borrow most of
his money as soon as it comes; he never has any use for it
himself, and it grieves me to see it laying round idle.
How much do you want?”</p>

<p>“Two dollars. Have you got it, Paddy?”</p>

<p>“’Fraid not; let’s see.” He pulled open a table
drawer and rummaged about until several pieces of silver
rewarded his search. Then he emptied his pockets, and the
two counted the result.</p>

<p>“Eighty-five cents,” said Paddy regretfully. “Hold
on; perhaps Dave has some change left. Sometimes I
leave him a few cents for pocket money.” He went to
his chum’s bureau and in a moment returned with a purse
which, when turned up over the study table, rained from
its depths four quarters and a nickel.</p>

<p>“Oh, the desavin critter!” cried Paddy. “Now,
where did he get all that wealth? Let’s see; that’s one
dollar and ninety cents. If we could only find another
dime——”</p>

<p>“That’ll do,” answered Wayne, as he pocketed the
coins. “I’ll write home to-night and pay you back as soon
as I get it. I’m awfully much obliged.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it. Is there anything else I can do
for you to-day?”</p>

<p>“Have you got anything to eat? I lost my dinner;
forgot it until a minute ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve got some crackers,” replied Paddy dubiously,
“and a tin of some kind of meat. It’s been opened a good
while, but I guess it’ll be all right after I scrape the
mold off.”</p>

<p>“Bring them out, will you? I’m in a hurry, Paddy;
I’ve got a recitation at 3.15.” Paddy whistled.</p>

<p>“In a hurry! Whisper, Wayne, are yez ill?”</p>

<p>“Shut up. Where’s the meat?”</p>

<p>The delicacies were produced and Wayne ate ravenously.
As Paddy had predicted, the tinned beef
was extremely palatable to the hungry boy after a
half inch of mold had been detached with the paper
cutter.</p>

<p>“Do you know a chap named Gray?” asked Wayne,
with his mouth full of cracker.</p>

<p>“Aisy, me boy!” cried Paddy. “Don’t choke yersilf.
Wait till your tongue has more room. Gray, did
you say? I know a youngster by that name in the lower
middle. He played ball on the junior nine last year when
they beat us by one run in twelve innings.”</p>

<p>“That’s the fellow. Where does he room?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I’ll soon tell you.” Paddy found
a school catalogue and turned the leaves. “Here we are:
Gray, Carl Ellis, Buffalo, N. Y., W. H. Vance’s.”</p>

<p>“Whereabouts is Vance’s?” asked Wayne, as he
scraped the bottom of the can.</p>

<p>“Just around the corner from the post office; a big,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
square, white house with green blinds and a cat-colored
roof.”</p>

<p>“A what?”</p>

<p>“Cat-colored roof—kind of a Maltese color, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m off. Thanks for the stuff! Tell
Dave——”</p>

<p>“Hold on and I’ll go with you. What’s up?”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t; I’m going alone. I’ll tell you about
it later—perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s a lark, you’re mighty mean not to let
a chap into it.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t a lark at all. By!”</p>

<p>Wayne hurried out and Paddy grumblingly closed the
door and watched him from the window.</p>

<p>“He’s mighty secret-like, I’m thinking, and mighty
hurried. I haven’t seen him move so fast since he came.
Must be something important. Wish I knew, bad cess
to him!”</p>

<p>Wayne trudged off up the village road and soon found
the boarding house with the “cat-colored roof.” Gray’s
name adorned a door on the second floor, and Wayne’s
knock elicited, after a moment, a faint “Come in!” The
room was a cheerful one with four big windows, but the furnishings
were tattered and worn and the walls were almost
bare of pictures. The floor was partly covered by a
threadbare ingrain rug and the green leather on the student<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
desk in the center was full of holes and spots. The
boy whom Wayne had seen in the principal’s office arose
from a chair at the desk as Wayne entered, and a half-written
letter before him told its own story. Gray’s eyes
were suspiciously red and the lad looked embarrassed and
ill at ease. Wayne, with a sudden recollection of Professor
Wheeler’s advice, plunged at once into the subject
of his visit.</p>

<p>“You’re Carl Gray, aren’t you? Well, my name’s
Gordon; I’m in the upper middle. I happened to be in
Wheeler’s outer office when you were in there. The door
was partly open and I couldn’t help hearing what was
said, and—and I’m awfully sorry, of course. But you see
it wasn’t my fault.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you heard it,” answered Gray, looking piteously
embarrassed; “but of course you—it wasn’t your
fault.”</p>

<p>“No—was it?” asked Wayne eagerly. “So I thought
that perhaps I could help you, and—” He stepped forward
and placed the money on the table. “There’s eleven
dollars there. I couldn’t get hold of any more, but you
said you had a dollar, you know, so perhaps that’ll be
enough.” Gray looked helplessly from Wayne to the
money and back again. Once he opened his mouth, but,
as he apparently could find no words, Wayne went on:
“I haven’t a mother myself, you see—she died when I
was just a youngster—but if I had I’d feel as you do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
about the bill; and of course Professor Wheeler won’t send
it to her if you pay this money to Porter to-day and tell
him about it.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see why—why you should lend me this,”
said Gray, at length. “You don’t know me and—and I
can’t pay you for a good while. I don’t get much of an
allowance, and——”</p>

<p>“I know,” replied Wayne cheerfully. “Fifty cents
a week. But pay me back when you can; I’m in no hurry.
And—and you might come and see me sometime; I room
in Bradley—No. 15.”</p>

<p>“I’ll pay you fifty cents every week until it’s all returned!”
cried Gray. “Why, I’d have done—done anything
to keep mother from knowing about it and having
to pay it! I was such a fool, wasn’t I? Bought clothes
and gloves and lots of things that I didn’t need just
because Porter said I could charge them and that he
wouldn’t ask for the money until I could pay it.”</p>

<p>“He ought to be kicked!” exclaimed Wayne angrily.</p>

<p>“He didn’t act decently,” continued Gray. “If he’d
only told me last year I could have had it almost paid by
now; but I thought there was no hurry, and—and—” He
stopped and dropped his gaze; then he went on in lowered
tones: “I wish I could make you understand how glad I
am and how much I thank you——”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up!” said Wayne, backing toward the door
and searching with his hand for the knob. “It’s all right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and I understand. And—well, I must hurry—got a recitation,
you know—may be late now.”</p>

<p>He had found the knob and the last words were spoken
from the hallway.</p>

<p>“But, I say, Gray, I wish you wouldn’t try to pay fifty
cents a week to me. I don’t need it, you know, and it’s
all your allowance, and——”</p>

<p>“I think I’d rather, if you don’t mind,” answered the
younger lad resolutely. He was smiling now and looked
quite healthy and happy; but something was glittering in
the corner of his eye, and Wayne seeing it, bolted downstairs
three steps at a time.</p>

<p>After Wayne left Hampton House Paddy went dejectedly
back to his Latin, but at the end of twenty minutes
found that he had remembered nothing of what he
had gone over, and so tossed his book aside, yawned,
glanced at the clock, and sallied forth in the direction of
Academy Building. As he turned the corner he caught
sight of Don coming down the steps and gained that
youth’s attention by a war whoop. Don was looking unusually
thoughtful as Paddy overtook him.</p>

<p>“Why, you look serious enough to have been visiting
‘Wheels’!” cried Paddy.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’ve been doing.”</p>

<p>“What—you? What’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you. It’s Wayne. He won’t attend gym
work and he’s told ‘Wheels’ as much, and ‘Wheels’ has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
threatened to put him on probation if he doesn’t report
to Beck to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“‘Wheels’ sent for me and asked me to use my persuasive
powers on the silly dub. But what can I do?
Wayne’s as stubborn as a mule, and he declares he won’t
attend; says it’s an injustice—that faculty hasn’t any right
to compel him to do gym work unless he wants to.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that he told all that rot to ‘Wheels’?”</p>

<p>“Every word, and a lot more, I guess.” Paddy
whistled.</p>

<p>“Well, he is a chump. Where is he? He came over
and borrowed some money awhile ago. What’s he up to
now?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me,” responded Don helplessly. “What
I want to know is, how can we keep the fellow from being
put on probation or suspended, for ‘Wheels’ declares he’ll
do both?”</p>

<p>“Why, we’ll get Dave, and the three of us will reason
with him.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! we might as well save our breath. I’d just
as soon reason with a lamp-post,” answered Don, in disgust.</p>

<p>“Hello! there he comes now,” said Paddy. “He’s
been to the village to see some fellow by the name of
Gray. Shall we walk down and try our arguments now?”</p>

<p>“No; let’s wait. You and Dave come up to the room
to-night and we’ll see what we can do with him,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Don. “I hate to have him get into trouble, because,
after all, he’s a good chap.”</p>

<p>“Of course he is,” answered Paddy heartily, “and
we’ll look after him all right. Why, if he won’t go and
take his gym work like a little man, after we’ve reasoned
with him, we’ll——”</p>

<p>Paddy stopped, grinning broadly, and slapped Don
triumphantly on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“I have it!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Have what?”</p>

<p>“A way, my lad.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Don eagerly.</p>

<p>“Why, if he refuses to go to gym to-morrow, we’ll
just— But I’ll tell you later. Here he is. Hello, Old
Virginia! where’ve you been?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just to the village,” answered Wayne vaguely.</p>

<p>“And did you spend all that money?”</p>

<p>“Every cent of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, pony up. Where are the goodies?” demanded
Paddy.</p>

<p>“Why, I—well, the fact is——”</p>

<p>“Cut it out. What did you buy?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Fact is I—I paid a bill.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>THE REVOLT ENDS</small></h2>


<p>The sun came up from behind Mount Adam, the
chapel bell rang, some two hundred boys leaped, crawled,
or rolled out of bed, and life at Hillton began the next
morning as though the day was of no more importance than
any of the five which had preceded it that week; in fact,
as though Wayne Gordon was not heroically resolved to
sacrifice himself upon the altar of principle.</p>

<p>While the unfeeling sun was coming up Wayne was
going through a most remarkable adventure. Plainly he
had won Professor Wheeler to his side, for together they
were besieged in the school library and had barricaded
the doors and windows with books, while from convenient
loopholes they maintained a rapid and merciless fusillade
of ancient and modern history, Greek and Latin text-books,
geometries, and algebras upon the heads of the
besiegers, who retaliated with chest weights, dumb-bells,
single sticks, and Indian clubs until the air was dark with
the flying missiles and the battle cries of the foes shook
the building. Wayne and the principal had just clasped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
hands and sworn to perish side by side, fighting grandly
to the last gasp for the right, when a whole covey of
chest weights came through a window and smote Wayne
on the head, and he awoke to see Don with a second pillow
poised, ready to throw.</p>

<p>“Get up, Wayne; bell’s rung!”</p>

<p>Wayne yawned, pitched the pillow back at Don, and
arose. He hadn’t slept well, and wished that Don
wouldn’t always insist on his getting up so early. And
he told him so. But Don was good nature itself that
morning and refused to argue or get cross, and Wayne
was perforce obliged to recover his wonted gayety, much
against his inclination, and trudge off arm in arm with
Don to chapel. And after he had got through with
a hearty breakfast, even the thought that probation
awaited him on the morrow failed to dispel his excellent
spirits.</p>

<p>For, as Don had feared, the combined efforts of the
three friends had failed to shake Wayne’s resolution. Don
had pleaded, Paddy had begged, Dave had threatened;
and Wayne had reiterated passionately his desire to suffer
martyrdom on account of his principles, and had utterly
and absolutely and finally refused to attend gymnasium
work to-day or to plead illness in extenuation. The three
friends had not appeared cast down—a fact at which
Wayne wondered not a little. It looked as though they
didn’t care whether he was put on probation or not, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
he had gone to bed deeply pessimistic on the subject of
friendship.</p>

<p>Wayne’s hour for physical training in the gymnasium
began at three, and when, five minutes before that
time, he issued from Academy Building resolved to proceed
to his room and put in the momentous hour at hard
study, he found Don and Dave and Paddy on the steps.
The two latter youths at once locked arms with him, much
to his surprise, for Dave especially was little given to such
expressions of friendliness, and the quartet moved toward
Bradley Hall.</p>

<p>“Why aren’t you and Dave on the campus?” asked
Wayne.</p>

<p>“Oh, we didn’t like to leave you alone this afternoon,”
answered Paddy, with a smile. “You see, we
have your welfare at heart, my boy, and we are going
to see that you don’t act silly and get put on probation,
and not be able to go to Marshall with us next
week.”</p>

<p>“If you mean not going to the gymnasium when you
say ‘acting silly,’” replied Wayne, with much dignity,
“why, then, I’m going to act silly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you’re not,” said Dave.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” demanded Wayne, striving to
withdraw himself from his friends’ clutches. They had
almost reached the steps of Bradley, and now they stopped
and faced about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just this,” said Dave. “We’ve tried persuasion and—and——”</p>

<p>“Entreaty,” prompted Don.</p>

<p>“And entreaty—and both have failed. So now we’re
going to use force. If you don’t agree to go to the gym
and do your work peaceable, we are going to take you
there.”</p>

<p>Wayne struggled violently, only to suddenly find his
feet off the ground, his arms held fast, and himself being
borne, kicking wildly, toward the gymnasium.</p>

<p>“Let me go, Dave! Paddy, you—you beast, put me
down!”</p>

<p>“Aisy, me child,” answered Paddy soothingly. “’Tis
for yer own good.”</p>

<p>“Don, make ’em let me go!” pleaded Wayne. But
his chum shook his head.</p>

<p>“Go you must, Wayne, so you’d better promise and
we’ll let you walk.” Wayne made no answer, only struggled
the harder.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to take his legs, Don,” panted Paddy.
“’Tis mighty unaisy he is.” They were crossing the
green now, and several fellows were hurrying nearer to see
what was going on. A group of boys on the steps of the
gymnasium were watching.</p>

<p>“It’s—it’s an outrage!” panted Wayne, his face white
with anger.</p>

<p>“Maybe it is,” said Dave calmly, “but we’re getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
you there.” Struggle was useless, and Wayne for a moment
lay quiet in the grasp of the three boys. Then he
caught sight of the watchers. It was public degradation!
He temporized.</p>

<p>“I’ll walk, fellows,” he said.</p>

<p>His bearers stopped and let him down.</p>

<p>“Will you promise to go to the gym?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“Yes,” growled Wayne. “But I’ll not do any work,
and nobody can make me!”</p>

<p>“Up with him!” cried Dave, and once more Wayne
was fighting in the arms of the three and being borne on
toward the gymnasium.</p>

<p>“What’s the fun, Paddy?” yelled one of the fellows
who were hurrying to meet them.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re just taking exercise,” answered Paddy
carelessly.</p>

<p>“What—what are you going to do with me?” asked
Wayne, in meeker tones.</p>

<p>“Carry you to the locker room, change your clothes,
take you upstairs, and give you, like a bundle of old rags,
to Professor Beck,” answered Dave.</p>

<p>“Let me down, then, and I’ll agree.” Once more he
found his feet, but the others took no chances and still
stood guard.</p>

<p>“Promise to do your work?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“Yes,” growled Wayne.</p>

<p>“Honest Injun?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“Honest Injun,” echoed the other.</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Dave. “Then let’s proceed.”</p>

<p>They walked on, Wayne striving to look at ease under
the inquiring gaze of many eyes as they passed up the
steps and into the building. In the locker room Dave and
Paddy left him to get into their own clothes and to hurry
away to the campus, while Don stood by and listened patiently
to all that Wayne had to say, which was much,
and not altogether polite or flattering. Then the two
proceeded upstairs and Wayne went through a long siege
with the dumb-bells and the chest weights. Professor
Beck made no sign, and Wayne wondered resentfully if he
was aware of his presence. He was, for after awhile he
came to the boy, watched him tugging the cords over his
shoulders for a moment in silence and then said:</p>

<p>“Don’t get yourself too tired, Gordon. Stop when you
think best.”</p>

<p>Whereat Wayne scowled, tugged the harder at the
weights, and resolved to stay until the class was dismissed,
hoping resentfully that he would injure his spine or some
other portion of his anatomy, and that Professor Wheeler
and Don and Paddy and Dave would be sorry and would
regret their treatment of him. This so cheered him up
that he was quite ready to forgive and forget when he had
dried himself after his bath, and so met Don with almost
a smile; for that youth, hoping for a reconciliation, had
abandoned a French recitation and had waited patiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
outside. Neither mentioned the recent affair as they
strolled off together, and by mutual consent the subject of
physical training was tabooed in their conversation for
several weeks. And Dave and Paddy evinced the utmost
tact, and were in turn forgiven on the morrow.</p>

<p>Professor Wheeler, however, was not so silent on the
subject nor so considerate of Wayne’s feelings. He summoned
the boy before him on the following day and earnestly
and kindly thanked him for his action in attending
the gymnasium; and Wayne, shifting uneasily from one
foot to the other, heard him through and then broke out
with:</p>

<p>“But I didn’t, sir!”</p>

<p>“Didn’t what?” asked the principal.</p>

<p>“Didn’t voluntarily attend the class.”</p>

<p>“But Professor Beck himself told me that you were
there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I was there; but—but—” And Wayne told
the circumstances of his attendance, and the principal
smiled broadly when he had finished.</p>

<p>“Well, well, that’s one way to persuade. I asked
Cunningham to see what he could do with you, but I
didn’t suppose he would use such—ah—heroic measures.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think it was his idea, sir,” answered Wayne.
“I believe Paddy was at the bottom of it.”</p>

<p>“Paddy? Oh, yes—Breen. I shouldn’t be surprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
if he was.” Professor Wheeler was smiling again. “Well,
it wasn’t so hard yesterday, was it, Gordon?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not very hard; but the principle——”</p>

<p>The professor held up his hands in simulated despair.</p>

<p>“Gordon, it’s a reckless thing to say, but let us forget
our principles for once. If I were you I’d try to keep out
of all trouble if for no other reason than to please three
such good friends as Cunningham and Breen and—er—Merton
have proved to be. I’d even put principle aside,
I think, and only consider that I was pleasing my chums.
Now, don’t you think you can afford to do that?”</p>

<p>Wayne thoughtfully smoothed the carpet with the toe
of his shoe.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he said, at length, “I think I can.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll attend the ‘compulsory physical education’
class in future?” Wayne scowled and tried the
effect of the other shoe for a moment.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he answered. “I’ll do gymnasium work,
but not because I think it is right, for I don’t. I still
think it’s wrong. But I’ll do it to please Don and Dave
and Paddy and—and——”</p>

<p>“And me,” said the principal smilingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. By the way, Carl Gray came to me
yesterday and told me about that money, you know. It
may please you to hear that the account will not be sent
to his mother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m very glad, sir,” responded Wayne heartily. “It
seemed too bad to have her know, didn’t it, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Professor Wheeler gravely. “I feel sure
that you don’t want thanks for the kindness, but I’d like
to tell you that it has made me very nearly as happy as it
has Gray; I disliked my duty greatly. Well, that’s all,
I think, Gordon. Come and see me sometimes. I’m
always glad to see you boys at any time, and especially
on Saturday evenings. I wish more of you could find time
to come then. Oh, by the way, you said the other day
that you were having hard work with your studies. Which
ones bother you most?”</p>

<p>“Greek and mathematics are the worst.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you could get a little help from some one
for a while. Have you tried?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I—I didn’t like to own up; all the other
fellows get along so well.”</p>

<p>“Not all, Gordon; there are others in your fix. Take
my advice and go and see Professor Durkee. He rooms in
your building. You’ll find him quite willing to help you
all he can; and he’s an excellent Greek man. He’s a
little—ah—well, crusty, Gordon, on the surface, but
you’ll find him kindness itself underneath. Try him.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir, I will.”</p>

<p>“Yes. And it’s all settled about the ‘compulsory
physical education,’ is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, only——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“What, have we struck a snag already?”</p>

<p>“No, only I’d like it understood that I’m doing it
under protest, sir.”</p>

<p>“That,” answered the principal gravely, “is of course
understood. Shall we shake hands on it?”</p>

<p>And they did.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>THE FOOTBALL GAME</small></h2>


<p>Thanksgiving recess began the following Wednesday,
to last until Friday evening, and many of the boys whose
homes were near by departed by the noonday train, superciliously
sympathizing with less fortunate friends whose
turkey and cranberry sauce were to be eaten in the school
dining hall. Paddy and Don had both received boxes of
canned and sugared delicacies from home, and a supplementary
feast, to follow the six o’clock repast in the hall,
was arranged to take place in Paddy’s room, and that youth,
who was to break training after the St. Eustace game,
promised himself to atone for two months of healthful diet
by a veritable orgy on indigestible luxuries.</p>

<p>Wayne, Don, and Dave, together with more than fifty
other Hilltonians, boarded the morning express and were
transported to the little down-river town of Marshall,
where their arrival was enthusiastically welcomed by several
score of St. Eustace fellows, headed by a brass band,
who escorted them twice through the village, and finally
left them, to recover their breaths before lunch at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
hotel. Hillton’s band was already on the ground, having
accompanied the football team the evening before, and
with the arrival of the wearers of the crimson a day of
hard work began for it. The band’s repertory was limited,
but its energy tremendous, and the Marshall population
gathered in front of the hotel to hearken to it and to be
mercilessly guyed by the Hilltonians who thronged the
broad veranda.</p>

<p>The game was to be called at 2.30. An hour before
that time Don and Wayne—Dave having taken up with
a St. Eustace acquaintance for the while—started across
the bridge to the far side of the river, where, hidden
almost from sight, the rival academy nestled amid its
trees. The field was already bright with blue banners
when the boys arrived and the St. Eustace band was busily
at work.</p>

<p>“What I don’t understand,” said Wayne, “is why we
don’t have to pay any admission.”</p>

<p>“That,” answered Don, “is because Hillton, when she
signed the athletic agreement with St. Eustace six years
ago, made it one of her terms that no charge should be
made for admission to any of the athletic events between
the two schools. Instead, a number of invitation cards are
printed. The home school gets two thirds of them for distribution
and the visiting school the balance. Of course,
it puts the cost of keeping up the eleven and the nine and
the other teams on the fellows and the grads, but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
seem willing enough to meet it. And, besides, as I know
from personal experience, it makes the captains and
coaches think more about economy; and we don’t very
often travel in parlor cars nor put up at the swellest hotels,
but we’ve managed to turn out a winning eleven two years
out of every three for a long time.”</p>

<p>“But other schools charge admission,” objected
Wayne.</p>

<p>“I know. St. Eustace does for every game except this
one. But the idea is ‘Wheels’s.’ He thinks that playing
football or baseball for the gate receipts smacks of professionalism;
‘sport for sport’s sake,’ says ‘Wheels.’ And I
think he’s right. Look at the big colleges; some of them
make from ten to fifteen thousand dollars as their share of
an important game.”</p>

<p>“But why shouldn’t they?” asked Wayne.</p>

<p>“Because they’re not professionals; they’re college fellows—the
players, I mean—and have no business going
around country like a lot of—of—circus folk, showing off
for money. And, besides, it’s bound to hurt college sport
after awhile. If a captain of a big team knows that by
having a winning eleven he can secure a game with another
big college, and get eight or ten thousand dollars,
why, in lots of cases it’s going to make that captain careless
about little things. He isn’t going to inquire too closely
into the standing of the fellows that make up the team;
he’s going to excuse a lot of laxity as regards training; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
he’s going to overlook lots of dirty playing, and all that
hurts the college in the end. No, I think ‘Wheels’ is
right; and so does Remsen and lots of the old fellows.”</p>

<p>“But, look here,” argued Wayne. “When a team
makes eight, or ten, or fifteen thousand dollars, you know,
that money doesn’t go to the players, does it?”</p>

<p>“Gracious, no!” exclaimed Don. “It’s generally
turned into the general athletic fund, and helps meet the
expenses of the crews and other teams that don’t pay
their way. But don’t you see that it’s a big feather in a
fellow’s cap if he can say that he made fifteen thousand
dollars for the athletic association! And the oftener a
college team makes a big pot of money the richer the
association gets, and the first thing you know it’s sending
its football and baseball teams around the country in a
private car, with a small army of rubbers and coaches and
a cook who prepares all the meals, just as though they
were one of those foreign opera companies! It’s all wrong,
Wayne. It isn’t good, honest sport; it’s—it’s tommyrot—that’s
what it is!”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it is,” answered the other boy thoughtfully.
“Anyhow, I shan’t kick, you know; it’s saved me
a dollar, I dare say.”</p>

<p>“No, it hasn’t, Wayne, because you’ll have to pay that
dollar, and maybe another like it, into the crew’s pocket,
or the baseball nine’s pocket, or the track team’s little
treasury in the spring.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I see. The idea is to have the school—that is,
the fellows and the graduates—meet the athletic expenses,
and not to ask the public for help.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” answered Don heartily. “But here comes
Hillton.”</p>

<p>A little squad of youths in crimson sweaters, headed by
Gardiner and followed by the Hillton band, defiled on to
the field, and the occupants of the stand where Wayne and
Don sat were instantly on their feet cheering lustily. The
band paraded with ludicrous dignity about the field, and at
last found seats near by and for the fifth time began its programme.
A moment later the St. Eustace players entered
and were greeted with acclaim from hundreds of wearers of
the dark blue and their friends, and received a cheer from
the rival contingent. The two teams and their substitutes
went busily to practicing, and Wayne watched Paddy, large
of bulk and quick of action, snapping back the ball and forming
the apex of numerous little wedges that grew and
dissolved under the tuition of the coach.</p>

<p>The seats about the broad expanse of faded turf were
filled now, and many spectators had taken up positions on
the ground just inside the ropes that guarded the side-lines.
Blue was the prevailing color, and only on one
small section of the stand did the crimson of Hillton
flutter. Presently the substitutes trotted off the gridiron
and squatted, Indian-like in their blankets, along the sides,
a coin was tossed, the teams took their positions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Paddy sent the new ball corkscrewing toward the St.
Eustace goal, where it was gathered into the waiting arms
of the St. Eustace full-back on the thirty-yard line and
advanced by him over two white bars ere the Hillton ends
downed him.</p>

<p>During the six years in which the athletic agreement
had been in force between the two academies Hillton had
won three of the football contests and tied one. Last year,
and again the year before, her eleven had triumphed
over the blue, and St. Eustace, with two consecutive defeats
rankling in her memory, was this year determined
upon victory. And it was the very general opinion that
she would win it. To be sure, Hillton had played the
usual number of games throughout the fall and had no
defeats behind her. Westvale Grammar School had been
beaten to the tune of 27 to 0; the local grammar school
had been whitewashed by a monotonously big score; the
neighboring military academy had managed to play a tie;
and Shrewsburg High School had accepted defeat after
a close and exciting contest, in which Greene had snatched
a victory by a spirited forty-yard run for a touch-down.
But those who knew shook their heads when the subject
of the St. Eustace game was mentioned, and talked vaguely
of a “lack of the right stuff,” a term which conveys nothing
to the mind of any one save a football player, but
which means everything.</p>

<p>The preceding Saturday evening the four friends, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
numerous other boys, had obtained permission to go to the
village and learn the result of the Harwell-Yates game,
and when, in the telegraph office, the report that Yates
had been the victor greeted them Paddy had sighed dolefully.</p>

<p>“That settles it,” he had said. “We don’t always win
from St. Eustace when Harwell wins from Yates, but
we’ve never beaten when she hasn’t. It’s St. Eustace’s
game.” And no amount of argument could shake his conviction.</p>

<p>Wayne and Don voted the first half of the game dull.
The teams were apparently evenly matched in defensive
playing, and nearly so in offensive work. The ball oscillated
from one twenty-five-yard line to the other, Hillton
and St. Eustace both looking for an opportunity to send
a back around for a run and finding none. Line-bucking
made up the most of the play, and at this each team held
its ground stubbornly when on the defensive, and attacked
gallantly when it had the ball. It was only at the end of
the half that anything exciting occurred. With but three
or four minutes to play, and the pigskin near Hillton’s
thirty-yard line in St. Eustace’s possession, the backs drew
away from the line, and amid a tense silence the ball was
passed to full for a try at goal. But Paddy it was who
frustrated the attempt by breaking through St. Eustace’s
line and receiving the ascending ball on his broad chest.
Don and Wayne were sitting on the lowest tier of seats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
so that the former might lead in the cheering, and as the
ball disappeared under a heap of wildly scrambling players
he was on his feet, cap in hand, and the Hillton section
was responding nobly to his appeal; the fellows delighted
at a chance to applaud something worth applauding. The
half ended with the ball in the arms of the Hillton full-back.</p>

<p>During the intermission Dave turned up, and the three
boys stamped about the ground to keep their feet warm
and sang “Hilltonians” vociferously to show their joy.
And the band did wonders.</p>

<p>“Looks like a tie, Dave,” said Don.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” responded that youth, with his
usual caution. “Paddy’s dreadfully used up; he’s been
playing center and left-guard and right-guard and half
the team. And if Paddy goes out—well, we might as well
go home and read about the game in to-morrow’s paper.”</p>

<p>“Bowles seems to be running the team well,” mused
Don.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s braced up wonderfully; he’s all right.
Gardiner’s delighted with him. Two weeks ago he couldn’t
hold a snapped ball.”</p>

<p>“Oh, have you seen Gardiner? What’s he say?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, but he looks cheerful. That’s a bad sign.
When Gardiner looks cheerful, it means that he’s worried.
Hello! here they come again. Let’s get these stuffed
images to cheer.” Dave turned to the seats: “Now, fellows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
you’ve been doing some of the worst cheering that
I ever heard outside of a girls’ school. We’re going to
win, but we’ve got to use our lungs. So let’s give ’em
nine long Hilltons, as though we were glad we’re living.”</p>

<p>The response was all that Dave desired, and he and
Don and “Pigeon” Wallace, president of the senior class,
kept the cheers going until the ball was aloft and the game
was on again.</p>

<p>St. Eustace forced the playing at once. Down the
field they came by short rushes, and ere the watchers on
the stand knew what was happening, the ball was on the
Hillton ten-yard line and the blue-stockinged backs were
massed close behind their line for a tandem on guard. A
yard resulted from this play. “Second down!” cried the
referee. “Four yards to gain!” The Hillton boys were
on their feet, cheering at the top of their lungs. Another
massed attack, and but two yards was needed by the St.
Eustace eleven. But those two yards were beyond accomplishment,
for Paddy led the crimson line in a sturdy,
desperate resistance, Hillton took the ball on her seven-yard
line, and a moment after it was sailing down the field
from Grow’s nimble foot, and Wayne, Dave, and Don were
yelling frantically and pounding each other enthusiastically
over the head.</p>

<p>But back came the ball as before, St. Eustace’s steady
short rushes being supplemented once by a stirring run
around Hillton’s left end that brought the blue’s champions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to their feet in a mighty burst of noise. Past the
middle of the gridiron went the charging St. Eustace
players, and the ball was down on Hillton’s forty yards
ere another five minutes had flown by. Then the whistle
piped shrilly and Dave clutched Don’s sleeve.</p>

<p>“Paddy’s laid out!” he cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>And so it was; and there was a deal of anxiety in that
little throng until the plucky center climbed to his feet
again and broke away from the trainer’s hands. Then
all Hillton shrieked joyously and the game went on. But
it was plainly to be seen that Paddy was suffering, and it
was equally evident that there was good reason; for he
had not only to play his own position, but to help the
guards as well, and now, to make his difficulties greater
and to increase his troubles, the opposing team had decided
upon a plan of play that made Dave writhe impotently in
his seat, and which caused even Wayne’s careless good
temper to revolt. Time after time the full force of the
St. Eustace backs was thrown upon Paddy. For long he
stood it doggedly, holding his temper in check under every
fresh assault; but there is an end to all endurance, and
now, with fifteen minutes of the second half gone, Paddy
was visibly weakening, and every successive plunge at the
center of the Hillton line resulted in a greater gain.</p>

<p>“There’s slugging going on there, Don!” cried Dave.
“That St. Eustace right-guard struck Paddy then. You
watch this time!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>The line-up was directly opposite the boys’ seats and
but a few yards from the side-line, and they watched
attentively as Paddy was helped to his feet and groped
his way to his place. “Tackles back!” called the St.
Eustace quarter, “78—36—76—16—” Then the two
lines met with a shock, there was a rasping of canvas,
and ere the Hillton line gave and the St. Eustace backs
piled through, a clinched hand rose and fell twice, and
Paddy fell weakly to his knees and slowly stretched himself
out on his face. Not only the three boys saw the
blows struck, but almost every fellow in the immediate
vicinity, and a veritable wave of hisses drowned the applause
of the St. Eustace cheerers. And at the same moment
Wayne, with blazing cheeks and angry eyes, leaped
from the stand, darted through the throng about the rope,
and strode menacingly toward the St. Eustace right-guard.
But before his upraised fist reached the surprised player
his arm was seized and in a moment he was struggling in
the grasp of two of the Hillton team. Half of the Hillton
crowd had impulsively followed Wayne’s lead, and now
an indignant horde broke through the ropes and invaded
the field with loud cries for vengeance.</p>

<p>It was a time for action, and Gardiner, Greene, and
several more of the wearers of the crimson resolutely
stemmed the tide, pleading and threatening in a breath.</p>

<p>“Fellows! Fellows!” cried Gardiner. “Go back!
It’s all right; don’t disgrace the school!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Get off the field, fellows!” shouted Greene. “I
swear I’ll knock down the first fellow that comes any
nearer! You’re acting like a lot of kids!”</p>

<p>“Make ’em take him off, then!” was the reply from
dozens of throats, as the crowd wavered and gave back unwillingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s all right—it’s all right,” said Gardiner
soothingly. “Only go back to the stand, like good chaps.”</p>

<p>The boys withdrew beyond the wrecked ropes again, but
did not immediately return to their seats. Many St. Eustace
fellows had drawn near and were glaring threateningly
toward them. Wayne, in the grasp of his friends,
was dragged off the field, trembling with anger and doggedly
promising the offending St. Eustace guard a licking
after the game. Paddy, with a badly bruised eye, was
supported to a place by the ropes, and the belligerent St.
Eustace player was ruled out of the game. The Hillton
contingent cheered lustily for Paddy and groaned derisively
at his assailant, and went slowly back to their places,
while the St. Eustace fellows were dispersed by some of
the older lads. Then some one caught sight of Wayne,
held in his seat by Don and Dave, and shouted, “Bully
for Gordon!” which cry was taken up by others and prolonged
until Don jumped up and faced the stand.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” he pleaded, “shut up, please! Everything’s
all right now. Only keep still, will you?”</p>

<p>Laughter and cheers greeted him and good humor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
came back to the crowd. A small junior shrilled, “We’ll
beat them, anyhow!” and the sentiment was applauded to
the echo.</p>

<p>But victory for Hillton was too much to expect with
Paddy no longer in line. Burton, who took his place, was
a fair center, but far from heavy enough to stop the opponent’s
triumphant advance down the field, and though
Hillton worked desperately for the next ten minutes the
ball was at length within scoring distance of her goal, and
again the St. Eustace full-back dropped back for a punt.</p>

<p>“Can’t be done from there,” whispered Don breathlessly.
“It’s forty yards, I’ll bet.” But Dave shook his
head.</p>

<p>“That full-back’s a wonder, they say, and I wouldn’t
be surprised to see him do it. If only we can get
through!”</p>

<p>But the St. Eustace line held like a wall, the ball sped
back, the full caught it neatly, and with admirable care
poised it in his palm before dropping it. Then his toe
caught it on the rebound and up it sailed, straight and unwavering,
cleanly between the posts and over the bar!
And blue flags waved and cheers for St. Eustace filled the
air, and Dave and Don looked sorrowfully at each other
and groaned in unison. Only Wayne in all that throng
seemed not to heed or care; he was watching vindictively
a boy who was waving a blue sweater on the far side of
the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no more scoring done, although the Hillton
team, to all appearances undismayed, returned to the
game with hammer and tongs, as it were, and forced the
ball to her opponents’ twenty yards ere she lost it for
holding, and afterward stubbornly and heroically contested
every inch of turf ere yielding it to the victorious
foe. But the whistle soon sounded, the two teams gathered
breathless in mid-field and cheered each other, the
St. Eustace band paraded the gridiron, followed by a shouting,
dancing train of ecstatic youths with blue flags, and
Wayne, still pining for vengeance, was dragged willy nilly
to the village and on to the train and borne back to school
under strict guard and in dire disgrace—a disgrace that
did not deter many a mistaken fellow from clapping him
on the shoulder, and whispering a hearty “Good boy, Gordon!”
into his ear.</p>

<p>“Pass a fork, Dave.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t one; use your knife.”</p>

<p>“Can’t get pickles out with a knife, silly. Can’t
you——”</p>

<p>“Here’s one,” said Wayne. “I was sitting on it.
When will Paddy get here?”</p>

<p>“Ought to be here now. Wish he’d hurry; I’m getting
most powerful hungry, as Old Virginia there says.”</p>

<p>“Will he be elected?” asked Wayne, as he struggled
with the cover of a biscuit tin.</p>

<p>“Sure to be,” answered Dave, who was arranging the
spread on the study table of No. 2 Hampton, now denuded
of its customary litter of books, paper, and rubbish.
“And he’ll be here pretty quick; I told him we’d wait
until nine, and if he wasn’t here then we’d start in.”</p>

<p>“Thunder!” yelled Don, suddenly leaping up and
dancing around the table.</p>

<p>“What?” cried the others, in a breath.</p>

<p>“Where’s the water? All the mustard in those pickles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
got on top and—” He buried his face in the pitcher that
Dave held out.</p>

<p>“Serves you right,” grinned Wayne. “Had no business
tasting things.”</p>

<p>“I like your cheek,” said Don indignantly. “You’ve
been sitting there eating biscuits for five minutes. Look,
Dave, he’s eaten the whole top layer off!”</p>

<p>“Pig!” cried Dave, and rescued the tin, placing it
on the table, where it was flanked by sheets of writing
paper in lieu of dishes holding potted duck, mince tarts,
a pineapple cheese, and preserved figs, the latter overflowing
in sticky streams on to the table top.</p>

<p>“What’ll we crack the nuts with, Dave?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“Nuts? Find one of Paddy’s football brogans in the
closet. Crack ’em on the hearth and stuff the shells in
Paddy’s bed. Too late, though—he’s coming, and he’s got
some one with him. Let’s welcome ’em.”</p>

<p>Paddy and Greene entered amid a fusillade of walnuts
and cork stoppers, and by concerted action ran Dave into
a closet and turned the key on him.</p>

<p>“Are you It?” asked Don eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’m It,” replied Paddy, striking an attitude. “And
Greene’s a back number—aren’t you, Greeney? And I can
pommel you all I want and not lose my place on the team,
can’t I?”</p>

<p>“<em>Hooray!</em>” It was the muffled tones of Dave from
the closet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shut up, you! Greene withdrew and so I got the
captaincy. He could have had it again if he’d wanted it.”</p>

<p>“Rot!” said Greene. “I was out of it, and I knew
it. Besides, I didn’t want it again. Three times is too
much. I’m awfully glad it went to Paddy. He’ll make a
good captain, Cunningham; don’t you think so?” Don’s
reply was interrupted by the sound of breaking wood.
Dave emerged from the closet in a heap, and, picking himself
up, seized Paddy and forced him into a wild dance
about the room.</p>

<p>“Hooray for Paddy—Captain Paddy!” he shouted.
In the dance Paddy’s nice white bandage came off and exposed
a very black eye, which lent a thoroughly desperate
and disreputable look to the countenance of the newly
elected captain of the football team.</p>

<p>“By the way, Greene, do you know Gordon?” asked
Paddy, as the boys found seats about the table and without
further ceremony began the feast. Greene didn’t,
and very graciously shook hands.</p>

<p>“You’re the fellow that got spunky to-day, aren’t
you?” he asked smilingly. Wayne nodded, looking bored.</p>

<p>“Wayne doesn’t like the subject,” said Dave. “It’s
a matter of lasting regret to him that he didn’t reach that
chap Kirkwell.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t worry, my boy,” said Paddy, as he filled
his mouth with cracker and jam. “I reached him once.
I didn’t do it the way I should have liked to, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
because I was seeing double and having hard work to keep
my pins, but I fetched him a very decent little jab on the
neck. He got me four times before I gave up—hang him!
Mind you, fellows, I don’t believe in slugging, and I never
did it before—that is, since I have been on the team—but
to-day I got tired of having him bang me every time
there was a mix-up, so I forgot myself.” And Paddy
grinned reminiscently and tried to wink his damaged eye
at Wayne.</p>

<p>“Kirkwell’s a dirty player,” said Greene. “Pass
some of that cheese, will you?—He played last year, you
know, and Jasper caught him slugging once in the game
with the Yates freshmen and put him off. Jasper’s St.
Eustace’s captain,” he explained to Wayne. “He’s an
awfully decent chap, too, and he promised me to-day that
Kirkwell shouldn’t play again if he could help it.”</p>

<p>“Dave, Wallace was up yesterday to ask about the
hockey team—wants you and me to join again. He’s got
seven games arranged; one with St. Eustace and one with
a high school club at Troy, or somewhere. Want to go
in?” And Don poised a tart in front of his mouth and
waited a reply.</p>

<p>“I guess so. You going to try, Paddy?”</p>

<p>“I might. There’s lots of time to decide. There’ll
be no decent ice on the river, I dare say, for a month yet.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to try for it,” continued Don. “We had
lots of fun last year. Can you skate, Wayne?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Wayne hesitated and munched a sandwich.</p>

<p>“Yes, I can skate,” he said finally. “But——”</p>

<p>“Then you’d better report next Saturday in the gym,”
said Don. “Greene, are you trying for a scholarship this
term?” Greene sighed.</p>

<p>“Trying? Oh, yes, I’m <em>trying</em>; but I haven’t the
least idea of making it. But I’m going to buckle down
now and put in some hard licks at grinding. I suppose
you’re sure of one, aren’t you, you lucky beggar?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not at all sure; but I may win a Master’s.
Paddy’s the only fellow here, I suppose, that’s certain of
a scholarship.”</p>

<p>“Indade an’ I’m not certain at all at all,” said Paddy.
“I’ve done well with Latin and fairly well with
Greek, but, whisper, English has me floored. And old
‘Turkey’ has been putting the screws on me all term,
bad scran to him. But,” continued Paddy, with
beautiful modesty, “me deportment has been of the
best.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll all know in a month; and there’s no good
in worrying,” said Dave. “Somebody have some more of
everything.”</p>

<p>“I can ate no more,” answered Paddy sorrowfully.
“It’s out of practice I am altogether.”</p>

<p>“And I’ve had enough,” said Don.</p>

<p>“Same here,” echoed Greene. “I must be getting
home. It’s ten o’clock, and I’m dog tired. Good night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
fellows; and better luck next year, Paddy. Any one going
my way?”</p>

<p>Wayne and Don arose, and the three said good night
and picked their way out through the darkened hall
and across the dimly lighted green toward their dormitories.</p>

<p>“By the way, Gordon,” said the ex-captain of the football
team, breaking the silence, “that was well meant to-day,
you know—your jumping on that St. Eustace fellow—and
nobody blames you; but—well, it isn’t just the thing,
you see—we don’t do it at Hillton. You—you see what I
mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Wayne gloomily. “I see what you
mean, but I don’t understand— Never mind, though,
I’ll remember next time.”</p>

<p>“Glad you take it that way,” said Greene. “It’s not
my place to mention it to you, only—being a chum of
Cunningham’s—and your first term here— Well, good
night, fellows.”</p>

<p>Wayne had almost fallen asleep, when he was aroused
by a muffled chuckle from the direction of Don’s bed.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” he asked sleepily.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” was the response. “I just remembered
that I put the walnut shells in Dave’s boots.”</p>

<p>When Wayne told Don that he could skate, he had not
been quite truthful.</p>

<p>“He asked me, ‘Can you skate?’” reasoned Wayne;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
“not ‘Do you skate?’ And of course I <em>can</em> if I try hard
enough!”</p>

<p>But the argument didn’t quite satisfy him, and he set
out to lend veracity to it by purchasing a pair of half-clamp
skates in the village and seeking an unfrequented
pond fully a mile from the school. About Wayne’s home
in Virginia skates were seldom seen and more seldom
used. But the boy had been ashamed to acknowledge his
ignorance before the others who did so many things well.
He had been about to qualify his assent by adding that he
could not skate very well when Don interrupted him.</p>

<p>To learn to skate without instruction is almost as difficult
as to learn to swim unaided, and Wayne’s troubles
began on the first afternoon that he eluded his friends and
sneaked off through the village. The pond was hidden
from the road by willows, and he had little fear of interruption.
After a struggle of several moments he at last
managed to affix his skates—he put the left one on the right
shoe, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>—and stepped on to the ice. The immediate
result was as surprising as it was disappointing, for
his first step resulted not in progress but in prostration, his
head coming in violent contact with the frozen earth at the
margin of the ice. He arose with a thumping headache,
and after a moment of painful bewilderment turned his
steps homeward, with a vastly increased respect for the art
of skating and a heightened dislike for it as the result of
his first lesson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>But he was back again the next day. He found a friendly
branch leaning out over the ice, and with its aid experimented
on his runners, making numerous remarkable discoveries
in the next ten minutes. He found that it was necessary
to place the rear foot at an angle while he advanced
the front one, and that as long as the center of gravity of
his body remained in advance of one foot he was in little
danger of falling. But as soon as the branch was discarded
he sat down just where the ice was hardest, and it took
him a whole minute of the most careful management to get
his feet under him again; and when that was accomplished
he discovered to his dismay that he was sliding, as though
propelled by invisible force, toward the very middle of the
pond, his skates gradually parting company and his body
held as though in the act of sitting. The thing was so disconcerting
that he was heartily glad when he did take a
seat, even though it was at a disheartening distance from
shore. He first considered crawling back to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</i> on
his hands and knees, but that would seem too much like
giving up; so he again went through the remarkable contortions
necessary to recover his equilibrium, and finally
reached the shore after a series of exciting adventures, during
which one skate became detached at the toe and his
breath forsook him entirely. Four more falls completed
that day’s lesson, and he went back to the school with his
head buzzing like a hive of bees and his body covered with
bruises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>A thaw set in that night, and for the next few days he
had to content himself with studying the art from a volume
of the Badminton Library. The book wasn’t much of a
help. It seemed as though the famous skater who had written
the chapter headed First Principles of Skating, and
Suggestions to Beginners, had been so overpowered by the
magnitude of his task that he had given up in despair before
he had begun. The few facts of practical value which
he had mentioned Wayne had already discovered by painful
experience.</p>

<p>But two weeks before Christmas, and a week before the
end of the fall term, the ice on the ponds again froze to a
respectable thickness, and Wayne continued his self-instruction.
Six excursions had been made to the little pond,
and the boy had attained to a degree of skill which allowed
of his circling the ice without falling, and he was fast becoming
both fond of the sport and proud of his ability. But
pride goes before a fall, especially in skating. One afternoon
Wayne had twice encompassed the pond, and was seriously
considering an attempt at skating backward, when one
runner encountered a twig imbedded in the surface, and he
took a most undignified tumble. His wounded feelings were
in no measure relieved by the peals of boisterous laughter
that issued from across the pond, where, hidden by the
willows, Paddy and Dave had crouched, interested spectators
of his disaster.</p>

<p>“Bully for Old Virginia!” bawled Paddy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“I say, Wayne,” shouted Dave, “do that again, won’t
you? I didn’t see the first of it!”</p>

<p>And then, as Wayne strove to recover his feet and his
dignity, their gibes took a new turn, and Dave asked Paddy
with elaborate politeness what the young gentleman on
the ice was doing; and Paddy assured him that he wasn’t
at all certain, but thought that the young gentleman was
looking for something he had dropped; whereupon Dave
thanked Paddy ceremoniously, and explained that he had
supposed, judging from the fact that the young gentleman
wore skates, you know, that the latter was skating; and
Paddy assured him that he was mistaken, oh, quite mistaken,
and that the young gentleman had no idea of skating;
and Wayne floundered dejectedly up and sat down
meekly on the bank, and told them mournfully that he
didn’t mind, only they might just cut out a little of it!</p>

<p>When Don was gleefully informed of the affair by
Paddy, he grinned delightedly.</p>

<p>“That’s just like Wayne,” he exclaimed. “Pluckiest
and obstinatest chump in school.”</p>

<small>GRAY GOES INTO BUSINESS</small></h2>


<p>The end of the fall term at Hillton is a busy time.
The examinations occur then, and the award of scholarships
is made on the last day of school. The less said about
Wayne’s performance at the examinations the better for
any good opinion the reader may entertain of that youth.
He struggled through; let that suffice. The highest scholarship
for the upper middle class, the Goodwin, went to
“Charles Fitzgerald Breen, New York city,” and Paddy,
blushing like a veritable junior, awkwardly bowed his
thanks and received a salvo of most flattering applause.
Don came in for the Carmichael scholarship, the next in
importance, and Wayne cheered loudly, until kicked into
silence by his chum. Dave’s name was not mentioned, but
he declared cheerfully that Paddy’s success was “glory
enough for all,” and displayed neither disappointment nor
envy. Wayne, you may be sure, expected no honors, and
so was not one of the many youths who took their way out
of the school hall in deep dejection.</p>

<p>Wayne was to spend the winter vacation with Don at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the latter’s home in Boston; Paddy’s holidays were to be
observed in New York; and Dave, alone of the four, was to
remain at school during the recess. Dave’s only near relatives—for
his father and mother were both dead—lived
in California, and a visit to them was out of the question.
Both Don and Paddy extended invitations, but Dave was
shy of strange people and houses and preferred to eat his
Christmas dinner in the academy dining hall; and so
one bright and cold morning he said good-by to his three
friends at the station, waved a golf club cheerfully after
the receding train, and loitered back to Hampton House,
whistling bravely but feeling very lonesome.</p>

<p>The winter vacation lasted two weeks, and Don and
Wayne enjoyed every instant of it, and returned to Hillton
when the new year was already a week old, refreshed in
body and mind, Don full of plans for the track team and
a victory for the crimson, and Wayne with his head
crowded with admirable resolutions regarding study. Acting
upon the suggestion of the principal, he had paid several
visits to Professor Durkee, whose rooms were on the first
floor of Bradley Hall, and the result had been most encouraging.
The professor of English was a lean and
wrinkled little man, well past middle age, whose crabbed
manner and stern enforcement of discipline had gained for
him the dislike of many pupils and the sobriquet of “Turkey.”
He was a hard taskmaster but a just one, and
many a boy could have told a tale of leniency and kindness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
in which the little professor would have figured well.
Wayne found him goodness itself under his crusty exterior,
and a most patient and lucid instructor in the studies that
bothered the boy most. And even after Wayne no longer
needed the professor’s assistance he continued his occasional
visits to the quiet study, and the two became firm
friends.</p>

<p>Adhering to his resolves, Wayne spent more time at
lessons, threatening to become, according to Paddy, a regular
“grind.” Paddy professed to feel the wildest alarm
over Wayne’s conduct, and suggested the infirmary as a
suitable residence for a while; but Wayne didn’t mind,
and before long even Don was forced to acknowledge that
his roommate was exhibiting a most commendable studiousness.
Alone in the study one afternoon, before a comfortable
fire, and doggedly struggling with Greek, Wayne was
interrupted by the entrance of Carl Gray. Ever since the
latter had accepted Wayne’s loan he had punctually appeared
each week with the promised fifty-cent payment,
and a certain intimacy had sprung up between the two
as a result of the visits. To-day he accepted the chair that
Wayne shoved forward and put his wet shoes up to the
blaze. But, contrary to custom, he did not at once bring
forth his half dollar, and his host thought he detected signs
of embarrassment on the younger boy’s countenance and
in his manner. They talked for a few minutes about school
topics and the prospects for skating on the river. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Gray edged uncomfortably forward in his chair and cleared
his throat.</p>

<p>“‘Wheels’ told me, that day you were in the office,
Gordon, that when you have an explanation to make the
best way is to go at it straight.” He paused and seemed
to be looking for inspiration in the glowing fire.</p>

<p>“Hang it, Gray,” exclaimed Wayne, “I don’t know
what you’re driving at; but if you’re trying to tell me that
you haven’t—that it isn’t convenient for you to pay that
old money to-day—why, cut it out! I’ve told you already
that I don’t need it. How many more times do you want
me to tell you?”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s it,” responded Carl Gray, breathing
easier and looking grateful for the assistance. “But I’d
like to explain about it. When I promised to pay you
fifty cents a week I wanted to do it and meant to, and I
still want to. I shan’t forget the—the kindness——”</p>

<p>“Cut it,” warned the other.</p>

<p>“Well, but I couldn’t know that—the fact is, Gordon,
that I didn’t get any allowance this week, and,
what’s more, I don’t think I’ll get any next week.
My mother writes that she has had to spend a lot of money
on—on something she hadn’t foreseen. And she says she
knows I won’t mind very much, since I have probably
got a little saved from what she has sent before.”
The boy paused and sighed. “I—I never told her, you
know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Wayne cheerfully. “But don’t
bother about my little old fifty cents, Gray. Tell your
mother that you have gobs of money—just rolling in it;
and if you don’t mind taking a loan——”</p>

<p>“No,” cried Gray sharply. “I’m not going to borrow
any more money. But it’s awfully good of you—indeed it
is. I don’t need any money—much; at any rate, I’m not
going to take any more from you. But I wanted to tell
you how it was, so that you’d understand that the reason I
didn’t pay you anything this week was because I didn’t
have it.”</p>

<p>“All right. Only don’t bother about it. Are you
lower middle fellows in the Anabasis?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the first book. But there is something else I
wanted to—to ask you about, Gordon. You see you’re
almost the only chap in the upper classes that I know; in
fact, I don’t know very many fellows, anyhow; and I
thought that if you could help me you would.”</p>

<p>“Of course I will,” answered Wayne heartily. “What
is it?”</p>

<p>“I want to earn some money. Not for myself exactly,
but I’d like to pay you, and I’d like to send a little to my
mother. I guess it would be a lot easier for me to send her
money than it is for her to send it to me. I was hoping I’d
get a master’s scholarship, Gordon, but I suppose that affair
of Porter’s bill spoiled that; it would have been awfully
nice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, it would. But how can you earn any money,
Gray?”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure, but I think I might make a little in
this way. Do you play golf?” Wayne shook his head.
“Well, fellows that do play have to give about thirty
cents for balls; they’re expensive little things, and after
they have been used a bit they’re likely to be dented and
out of shape. Then they need to be remolded. Of course,
remolded balls are never quite as good as new ones, but
they’re all right for ordinary use and good enough for lots
of the fellows here.”</p>

<p>Wayne had jumped up and now returned to the fireside
with a handful of damaged golf balls, collected from various
parts of the room.</p>

<p>“Are those the things?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Gray. “I can remold those. I
learned how last year. A fellow I know has loaned me his
press and I have everything else necessary. I thought that
perhaps you wouldn’t mind speaking to the fellows you
know, just telling them that I’ll remold their old balls for
ten cents apiece, and do it well. Then, if they had any
for me I could call and get them. Don’t you think that
would be all right?”</p>

<p>“You bet,” said Wayne. “That’s a jolly good idea.
I’ll get lots of balls for you to fuss with. And you can
take these along with you now. Let’s see—two, four, six,
nine of ’em in all. They’ll do to practice on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“But, I say, Gordon, they’re not yours, are they?”</p>

<p>“Mine? Great Jupiter, no! What would I be doing
with the silly things? They’re Don Cunningham’s.”</p>

<p>“But will he want them remolded?” asked Gray doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Of course he will, when I explain it to him. Here,
put ’em in your pockets. And to-morrow, Gray, come
around here about this time and I’ll let you know what
can be done. I think it’s a jolly good scheme, and there
are so many fellows here that play golf that we ought to
be able to find heaps of old balls. If we could get hold
of, say, a hundred, that would mean ten dollars, wouldn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, only it wouldn’t be all profit, you know. Gutta
percha costs quite a bit and so does paint. But it would be
a lot of money, just the same; though if I could get fifty
balls I’d be satisfied, Gordon.”</p>

<p>“Fifty? Pooh!” said Wayne. “We’ll get lots more
than that. Just you wait and see.”</p>

<p>“You’re very good to help me; it will be a bother, I
know; and you are so busy with your lessons, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll find time between recitations, you know,”
replied Wayne. “Come up about this time to-morrow.
So long.”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” answered Gray, “and—and thanks awfully,
Gordon.” Wayne scowled.</p>

<p>“Say, Gray, I wish you weren’t so full of ‘thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
you’s.’ You just tire me to death with them.” Gray
smiled from the doorway.</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll try to remember. Good-by.” He
closed the door behind him, and Wayne turned back to his
book. “I’ll bet Dave’s got a lot of old golf balls,” he muttered
as he found his place. “I’ll speak to him to-night if
I see him.”</p>

<p>But Dave didn’t turn up that evening, and the next
afternoon, as soon as the last recitation was over, Wayne
took a pad of paper and a pencil and started out to drum
up trade. His first visit was to Hampton House, where he
discovered both Dave and Paddy writing fast and furiously
at the table, an atmosphere of excitement about them.
Paddy stopped long enough to explain what was up.</p>

<p>“We’re going to have a grand spectacular skating carnival
on the river next Wednesday. All the fellows are
going in for it. Wallace and Greene and I are the committee,
and——”</p>

<p>“What committee?” asked Wayne.</p>

<p>“Oh, just a committee, you know, to get up the programme
and arrange for the prizes and all that. We’re
going to have a lot of races, handicap, novice, class, and a
hurdle race. Say, will you enter the novice?”</p>

<p>“I reckon so.—Are you going to try, Dave?”</p>

<p>“Yep,” answered Dave, looking up for a moment from
his work. “I’m down for everything.”</p>

<p>“But how do you know that there’ll be any ice by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Wednesday, Paddy?” asked Wayne. Paddy nodded gleefully
toward the front window.</p>

<p>“Look at the thermometer, my lad; it was only twenty
above a minute ago, and it’s been going down steadily since
noon. Oh, don’t you worry about the ice. <em>That’s</em> all
right.”</p>

<p>“Well, just as you say, Paddy.—Dave, have you got
any old golf balls?”</p>

<p>“Yep, somewhere. Why?”</p>

<p>“I want ’em.”</p>

<p>“Well, look about the place. There’s one or two in
that mug over there.” Wayne searched the mantel and
what drawers he came across, and soon had seven badly
battered little globes before him. He shook his head.</p>

<p>“Those aren’t nearly enough,” he muttered. He
looked around and his eyes lighted on Dave’s closet. The
boys at the table were too busy to heed him as he opened
the door and brought out a box containing eight brand-new
Silvertowns. At the hearth he laid his find down and
picked up the fire shovel. Placing one of the immaculate
white balls on the hearth he proceeded to knock dents in
it. It was hard work, but he at last managed to disfigure
six of the eight and was hammering at the seventh when
a glancing blow sent the little ball whizzing into the air to
the table where it landed with a bang under Dave’s
nose.</p>

<p>“What in thunder?” he cried, staring at Wayne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“Beg pardon, Dave,” said that youth, as he attacked
the last ball with the fire shovel.</p>

<p>“But what—what are you doing, you idiot?” shrieked
Dave.</p>

<p>“Why, you see, I could only find seven old ones, Dave,
and I had to have lots more than that.” Then he explained
about Carl Gray, and Paddy forgot the skating carnival,
for laughing at Dave’s dismay at sight of his new balls.
But the latter was soon won round to what Wayne called
a proper view of it, and consented to pay ten cents apiece
to have the fifteen balls remolded, and Wayne took himself
off with his pockets bulging out as though each had the
toothache. In the next hour he paid innumerable calls on
his acquaintances—he was surprised to find how many he
had—and at five o’clock returned to Bradley with a list
which ran thus:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cooper, 25 Masters, 3.</li>

<li>Benson, 36 Turner, doesn’t know how many.</li>

<li>Moore, 30 Masters, 6.</li>

<li>Duane, 8 Bradley, 2.</li>

<li>Harrington, Goodrich’s house, lots of balls.</li>

<li>Greene, 17 Warren, 10. Wants to know if you
    can mend a club; told him thought you could.
    Call at noon.</li>

<li>Bradford, 4 Turner, 6. Call after chapel.</li>
</ul>

<p>There were as many more entries on the list, and Gray
was delighted and full of gratitude to Wayne. When he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
saw some of the fifteen balls that Wayne produced from
his overcoat pockets he examined them curiously.</p>

<p>“These eight are awfully queer-looking balls,” he said.
“Look as though they’d been kicked about in a coal bin.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you can’t tell what Dave may have been doing
with them,” Wayne answered. “I dare say he’s been trying
to burn them in the grate. But don’t you care; take
’em along and fix ’em up, and if they’re harder to do than
the others, why, charge fifteen cents for them.”</p>

<p>“They won’t be,” said Gray, laughing. “There isn’t
much wrong with them, and a coat of paint will do for several.
And I’ll take the list around to-morrow and get the
balls. I think I can fix that club of Greene’s; perhaps I
could find others to mend. Really, Gordon, I’m awfully
much ob——”</p>

<p>“Get out of here!” shrieked Wayne savagely. Gray
got out, but in the hall he stopped.</p>

<p>“O Gordon!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>Then he scuttled downstairs.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>THE MYSTERIOUS SKATER</small></h2>


<p>The skating carnival received faculty indorsement in
an odd way. Paddy entered Academy Building one morning
to find Professor Wheeler in front of the bulletin
board, on which the entry list for the races was posted.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Breen,” said the principal. “I see
that you are going to have a skating carnival.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Paddy.</p>

<p>“I used to skate once, Breen; I wonder now if I’ve forgotten
how? I believe I’d like to try it, anyway. Couldn’t
you add a faculty race, Breen? I’d enter—that is—”
He paused doubtfully. “That is, you know, if I can find
another member of the faculty to race with. And I think
I can; yes, I’m certain of it,” he added smilingly. “Add
the faculty race, Breen, and I’ll promise you two contestants
at least.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do it, sir,” answered Paddy eagerly.</p>

<p>“Very well; come to the office to-morrow and I’ll give
you my fee.” And the principal went off smiling broadly,
and Paddy flew to report the wonderful news to Wallace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and the other members of the committee. The next day
Professor Wheeler paid his entrance fee, and a second fee,
which he explained was for another member of the faculty
who had consented to race.</p>

<p>“And who is he, sir?” asked Paddy.</p>

<p>“Ah! that is a secret at present, Breen. But there is
his fee, and you may enter him as X——, an unknown
quantity. And he’ll be on hand next Wednesday. By
the way, what distance is this faculty race to be?”</p>

<p>“We thought a half mile would suit,” answered Paddy.</p>

<p>“A half mile? Tut, tut, my boy, we’re not so old and
disabled as that. Change it to a mile, Breen, if you
please.”</p>

<p>There was a deal of speculation throughout the school
as to the identity of the second faculty member. It might
be Tomkins, who was big and strong enough to win a race
on skates; or it might be Beck—most of the boys thought
it was—for he could skate well and frequently did. Or—well,
it might be any one of the thirteen instructors, barring
“Turkey,” of course, who was too old to skate and might
blow to pieces in a stiff breeze. The day of the racing
carnival was awaited impatiently.</p>

<p>Wayne meanwhile practiced almost every day on the
lake or the river, preferring the former because less frequented.
Often Dave and Don accompanied him, and the
three took turns at holding Don’s stop-watch while the
others raced together over the mile or half-mile course.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
The afternoon preceding the carnival was almost dark
when the boys took off their skates at the river’s edge and
started up the steep bank below the campus and a long
half mile from the Academy. They were going to cut
across the fields to the village and leave their skates to be
reground for the morrow’s contests. But halfway up the
ascent Dave paused and drew the others’ attention to a
figure across the river. Wayne and Don stopped and followed
the direction of Dave’s arm. Under the shadow of
a clump of trees across the bare sweep of purple ice they
could just make out the form of a person skating slowly,
and, as it appeared, stealthily up the river, holding as close
as possible to the gloom afforded by the fringe of bushes.</p>

<p>“Who is it, I wonder?” said Don.</p>

<p>“Probably one of the fellows who has been practicing
down stream in the hope of surprising us to-morrow?” suggested
Dave. But Wayne shook his head.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a boy, it’s a man; and he’s got a long muffler
around his neck. See, he’s stopped!”</p>

<p>“Where is he?” asked Dave. “I can’t see him now.”</p>

<p>“Look straight across to the thickest clump of bushes.
He’s in the dark there, and I believe he’s watching us.
Looks as though he didn’t want to be seen, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it does.—I say, fellows, let’s go over and have a
look at him. What do you say?”</p>

<p>Don’s suggestion was greeted with enthusiasm, and the
boys tumbled down the bank again and proceeded to don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
their skates. The twilight had deepened now, the river
had become a broad path of gray between its darker shores,
and the figure beneath the trees was lost to sight.</p>

<p>“Is he still there, do you think?” asked Dave, as he
struggled with his clamps.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Wayne, “I’ve watched. If he goes on
he’ll come against that light space of sky there and we can
see him.”</p>

<p>Dave’s runners were fastened first and he started across
the ice, whispering to Don to hurry after, and in a moment
was part of the gloom. Don followed the next instant, and
Wayne, still working with his obdurate straps, was left
alone. Then came a whistle and the sound of ringing
blades on the frozen surface. He slipped the last buckle
into place and followed up the river in pursuit of the
skaters. Once he heard a shout, but he could see nothing
save the high bank beside him, and, far up the ice, the
twinkling lights of the school buildings. Once he came a
cropper over a protruding spit of graveled beach, but
picked himself up and was soon on his way again.</p>

<p>Suddenly the sound of skates ahead of him, and drawing
nearer, brought him to a pause.</p>

<p>“That you, Dave?” he shouted. “That you, Don?”</p>

<p>There was no reply; but a figure, black and formless,
shot out of the gloom ahead, swung about with a short
sweep of grinding runners almost under his nose, and again
disappeared in the direction from which it had come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Wayne gave a cry and started in pursuit. It was like playing
blindman’s bluff. Sometimes he thought he caught a
glimpse of a darker spot in the blackness ahead, but was
not certain. His own skates drowned the noise of those
ahead. But the twinkling lights grew nearer and nearer,
and he gave a long shout of warning to Dave and Don, who
must, he thought, be waiting for him ahead. An answering
shout from far off sounded, and Wayne slid for a moment
and strained his ears for the sound of skates. He
heard it, but judged that the unknown had gained on him,
and he strained every muscle to overtake him. As near
as he could tell he was now at a point almost in the middle
of the river and about opposite the boat house. The next
moment he swept toward the latter, for above the noise of
his own skating he had detected the sound of clumsy steps
on the boat-house landing. And then, while he believed
himself still well out from the shore, his ankles encountered
the edge of the landing and he pitched, headforemost, halfway
across it, and sat up just in time to hear a chuckle in
the darkness and the sound of footfalls on the steps leading
up the cliff to the path above. With an exclamation of
anger Wayne got up, stumbled across the planks, and tried
to climb the stairs. But his skates were sadly in the way,
and he soon gave up the effort and felt his way back to the
edge of the landing, where he sat and rubbed his bruised
shins and shouted for the others. Don arrived first, breathless
and excited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“I almost had him!” he panted, “but he doubled just
off the point and he’s gone back down the river. Where’s
Dave?”</p>

<p>The two shouted loudly, and an answering hail came
from near at hand. The next instant Dave felt his way
cautiously up and fell into Wayne’s lap.</p>

<p>“Did you see anything of him?” he gasped. Don repeated
what he had told Wayne.</p>

<p>“Where did you say he turned? At the point under
Academy Building?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Don.</p>

<p>“Why, you idiot, that was me!” Wayne laughed and
Don returned, a trifle crossly:</p>

<p>“Well, why didn’t you sing out, then?”</p>

<p>“Because I didn’t suppose you were chasing me. I
thought you were just following. I never caught sight of
the fellow after he darted out of the bushes and struck up
the river. He was gone in a second.”</p>

<p>“Well, you won’t catch him,” said Wayne. “He’s got
home by this time.” And he recounted his adventures.
Dave whistled.</p>

<p>“He was a bully skater, anyhow. I’ll bet it was
Paddy!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” answered Don. “He wasn’t built like
Paddy.”</p>

<p>“No, he wasn’t one of the fellows,” Wayne said. “He
was a man, not very tall, and he had a muffler wound round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
his neck. And—and the funny thing about it is, that it
seems as though I had seen him before somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Well, let’s get these silly skates off and hurry up
about it,” said Don disgustedly. “It must be getting late,
and I don’t want to have to feed on crackers and sardines
the way I had to the other night. And we must get permission
to take the skates to the village after supper.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow,” said Wayne, as he tugged at his straps,
“I’m sure of one thing; and that is, if I see that fellow to-morrow
I’ll recognize him.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” responded Dave.</p>

<p>Wayne found a note from Carl Gray, together with
Don’s remodeled golf balls, on his table when he returned
to his room after supper. Don examined the balls with
interest.</p>

<p>“Pretty good work, I call it, Wayne. They look about
as good as new and have a dandy coat of paint on ’em.”</p>

<p>Wayne read the note. “Friend Gordon,” it ran,
“here are those balls of Cunningham’s. Some of them are
not done very well. They were the first I tried, and didn’t
mold so well as I’d like to have had them. I wish you’d
not let him pay for them, because they’re not very good
and you’ve helped me a lot.” (“Of course I’ll pay for
them,” interrupted Don.) “I’ve remolded over forty balls
so far, and have nearly twice that many to do yet. I
thought you’d like to know how I was getting on. I sent
some money home to-day and am going to pay you Saturday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
I fixed Greene’s cleek, and I think it as good as new;
and I have three more clubs to mend. If business keeps
on increasing I’ll have to open a shop, I guess. Couldn’t
find you, so write this instead. Yours, Gray. P. S.—<em>Thank
you.</em>”</p>

<p>The last sentence was much underscored, and Wayne
grinned as he threw the note aside.</p>

<p>“Decent chap, that Gray,” he said.</p>

<p>“I can’t say as to that,” answered Don, “but I do
know that he’s a good hand at remodeling golf balls.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>THE FACULTY RACE</small></h2>


<p>When Paddy awoke the next morning his first act was
to throw back the blinds and look eagerly at the thermometer
hanging outside the window. It recorded fourteen
above zero, and he gave a grunt of satisfaction as he scurried
to the fireplace, raked the embers together, and added
a fresh log. There was no likelihood of either snow or rain
marring the skating surface of the river, and the state of
the thermometer precluded a thaw. Paddy was in the best
of spirits all the forenoon, as he and Wallace and the other
members of the committee scurried from the school grounds
to the village, and from the village to the scene of the coming
contest on the river.</p>

<p>The “skating carnival” had been proclaimed far and
wide; its fame had even reached the neighboring towns
along the Hudson, and at two o’clock the boat-house float
and steps and the river bank, as well as the frozen surface
thereabouts, was thronged with townspeople from Hillton,
Euston Point, and other hamlets. Of course the academy
turned out in full force; the junior class attended in a body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
prepared to aid their champions by every feat of lung and
throat. A clear stretch of smooth ice about ten yards from
the shore had been roped off for the track whereon the
sprints and a hurdle race were to be contested, while a
series of red flags—borrowed from the golf club—marked
the course of the half-mile and mile events. There was an
appearance of dignity and importance about the scene that
pleased Paddy mightily, and made him carry his bright
blue badge with great pride.</p>

<p>Dave, with his usual hopefulness, had entered for everything
for which he was eligible. Don was down for the
hurdle race and a half-mile event, and Wayne had entered
for the mile race for novices. Paddy was to take part in
the class event and the mile. The afternoon was a perfect
one for the sport. The sun shone dimly at times, the
breeze, too light to interfere with speed, was nipping cold,
and the ice was in fine condition. Professor Beck had consented
to act as referee, and several of the other professors
wore judges’ badges and tried earnestly to understand their
duties.</p>

<p>There were many entries for the half-mile handicap
and a lower middle-class fellow won it easily from scratch.
In the mile race for novices Wayne finished well up in the
first crowd and was quite elated. Both Paddy and Dave
were entered in the mile event, and the former won from a
field of some twenty fellows by a generous ten yards. Dave
struggled along bravely and cheerfully, and seemed well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
satisfied with sixth place. When the class race was called
twelve boys stood on the mark, three entries from each
class, and the juniors gathered in a body at the starting
place and cheered their men and their class loudly and tirelessly
until the contestants sped away over the shining
course, their runners ringing musically on the frosty air.
Dave was one of the chosen three representing the seniors,
Paddy held the hopes of the upper middle class, and the
lower middle banked on the fleet youth who had previously
won the half-mile handicap. The juniors placed implicit
faith in a small and wiry boy who looked scarcely over thirteen
years of age. The twelve kept well together for the
first of the three laps constituting the mile, but when the
flags were reached the junior champion sprang to the front,
followed by the three senior class fellows, and the balance
strung themselves back along the course, Paddy laboring
manfully to hold himself in for the last half lap. As the
skaters sped by the point where Wayne and Don were
watching, the former recognized one of the lower middle-class
entries as Carl Gray, and drew Don’s attention to
him.</p>

<p>“Gray?” said Don. “Oh, the fellow that comes to see
you every week on that mysterious business? Well, he
skates well, doesn’t he? He ought to finish pretty decently,
I should think. Paddy’s just dying to ‘go up
head,’ isn’t he? And look at old David; wouldn’t you
think he was an ice wagon on runners? Poor old chap!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
I believe if somebody got up a flying match he’d
enter.”</p>

<p>“He ought to have known better than to have got in
the lead so early in the race,” said Wayne.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess he thought that if he didn’t get in front
now he never would,” laughed Don. “But he’ll not be
there after this round.”</p>

<p>And he wasn’t. When the last spin over the course
began, it seemed as though Dave stood still, for the entire
field of skaters, with one exception, sped by him ere the
remaining distance was one fourth traversed. The single
exception was the small junior who had forced the skating
and who was now too used up to keep his lead. A hundred
yards from the finish eight of the ten leaders were so closely
bunched as to render guessing the winner a difficult feat,
and Wayne and Don, shouting loudly for Paddy, didn’t
know who had won until the judges gave out the result a
moment later: Breen, first; Gray, second; Wallace, third.
The upper middle had captured first place, the lower middle
second, and the seniors had to be content with the third
prize. Dave and the small junior fought stubbornly for
precedence and the latter won by a yard, and Dave was
enthusiastically presented with a piece of ice, in lieu of a
booby prize, by a delegation headed by Don.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a flight of six hurdles, two and a half feet
in height, had been put in place, and Don and three other
fellows—one of them Greene—were on the mark. Hurdle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
racing on skates is a difficult accomplishment, even when
low hurdles are used, and success depends not alone on
speed. The contestant who has not undergone the hardest
practice over the bars and learned to take them in much
the same manner as does the hurdler who is running on
cinders, might as well save his breath, and possibly a hard
fall. Of the four contestants entered Don was acknowledged
the best, since his long training at track hurdling
enabled him to perform on ice in beautiful style. Although
not so speedy a skater as Greene, he was a more perfect
hurdler, and he was looked upon as the winner. The jumps
were placed thirty yards apart, and the entire distance to
be raced from starting line to finish was two hundred and ten
yards. At the report of the pistol the four started well together.
Conroy, a lower middle-class fellow, took the lead
and covered the twenty yards intervening between the line
and the first hurdle at fine speed, but only to come an inglorious
cropper at the first leap and to find himself utterly out of
the race ere it was well begun. Greene, and Jackson, the
fourth man, took their hurdle side by side, and were halfway
to their second before Don was in the air. At the third
hurdle, however, Jackson was behind, and Don and Greene
were rising for the jump at the same moment. And now
form over the obstacles began to tell, for while Greene was
able to cover every intervening twenty yards at a faster
pace than Don, the latter gained ground at every hurdle,
taking off at his full speed and in each case barely topping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the wood, while Greene perceptibly decreased his speed
before each leap and always jumped from three to six
inches higher than was necessary.</p>

<p>Cheers for the boys filled the air as they raced for the
last hurdle, Don a bare foot in advance of Greene, and
Jackson just taking his fifth jump. At the sixth hurdle
Greene’s performance was even clumsier than before, and
Don’s skates clanged down on the ice at the very moment
the former was rising to the jump. But in another moment
the two were again almost side by side, for on the level
Greene’s speed told, and it was nip and tuck to the tape.
But Don managed to hold the slight advantage gained at
the last hurdle and Greene accepted second place by the narrowest
sort of a margin.</p>

<p>“If you were as fast on skates as I am, or I was as
crack a hurdler as you are,” he told Don laughingly, “one
of us would be a wonder.”</p>

<p>A half-mile straight-away race followed, but Don, who
had entered for this event, stayed out, being too winded to
do himself justice, and the race was won by the small
junior, who had somehow found his speed again. And then
the event of the day was called, the great faculty race,
in which Professor Wheeler and a mysterious Unknown
were to compete over the mile course. Conjecture as to
the identity of the Unknown was still rife, and as Professor
Wheeler, on a fine new pair of full-clamp skates,
advanced to the starting line, the throng watched and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
waited impatiently for the other competitor. All the professors
were present, even “Turkey,” and not a few wore
skates. It might be any one of them. Professor Beck
skated to the line, and a murmur of “It’s Beck!” arose,
only to be drowned by a second murmur of “No, it’s Longworth!”
as the junior instructor in mathematics also approached.</p>

<p>“Who is the other competitor, sir?” asked Wallace,
who was to act as starter. The principal looked toward the
shore.</p>

<p>“He is coming now, Mr. Starter,” he answered smilingly.
The throng about the line followed his gaze and
gasped in wondering amazement. Skating toward them,
and leaving a ripple of amused laughter in his wake, his
head covered with a fur cap whose lappets were drawn
down over his ears, with a long woolen muffler wrapped
about his throat and a pair of old-fashioned wooden skates
strapped to his feet, came—Professor Durkee!</p>

<p>A moment of silent surprise was broken by a laugh that
quickly resolved itself into a loud cheer. On the outskirts
of the crowd, where they could not be seen, impish juniors
doubled themselves up with laughter. More dignified
seniors shouted hoarsely to keep from following the example,
and even Professor Beck smiled broadly at the odd
figure of the principal’s rival for honors. Whether Professor
Durkee was aware of the sentiments aroused by his
appearance none can say; if he was he carefully concealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the fact; and after a few explanations from the referee
the two professors stood on the mark, silence fell, the pistol
banged, and the great faculty race was on!</p>

<p>Professor Wheeler sped away up river at a pace that
soon dropped the English instructor yards behind. But
fellows who knew the length of a mile on ice shook their
heads and predicted that the pace was too good to last.
Perhaps Professor Durkee thought so too, for he made no
effort to win the side of the flying principal, but skated
serenely on, his coat tails and the ends of his knitted gray
muffler flying in the wind.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he a sight?” asked Don, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s something to dream of,” giggled Paddy.
“But he can skate, can old ‘Turkey’! He has a style
like—like—a scarecrow.”</p>

<p>At that moment Dave flew frantically up.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” he gasped. “It was ‘Turkey’——”</p>

<p>But the words were taken out of his mouth by Wayne,
who slid out of the crowd and embraced Paddy to keep
from falling.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows, it was Professor Durkee that we saw on
the river last night.”</p>

<p>“And chased!” supplemented Dave.</p>

<p>“Get out!” cried Don. “Who said so? How do you
know?”</p>

<p>“Recognized him!” answered Wayne. “Knew him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
soon as I set eyes on him. I told you last night that it was
a man, and that he wore a muffler thing around his neck.
Remember?”</p>

<p>“And I know too,” said Dave. “He looked just as he
does now when I saw him.”</p>

<p>“Well, the desavin critter!” exclaimed Paddy.</p>

<p>“I’ll just bet it was him!” said Don. “He had been
practicing and didn’t want us to see him.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I’ll bet he’ll beat ‘Wheels’ all hollow!”</p>

<p>The boys crowded their way to a place by the course.
Far up the ice the flying figures were making the turn and
heading back to the starting point. It was difficult to discern
which was ahead, but presently as they drew nearer
Professor Wheeler was seen to have maintained his lead of
about twenty yards. Cheers, loud and prolonged, greeted
the skaters as they made the turn and commenced the
second round.</p>

<p>“Go it, ‘Turkey’!” yelled the throng, all forgetful of
respect in the excitement of the moment.</p>

<p>“Bully for ‘Wheels’!” cried others, and only ceased
when Professor Beck was seen smiling broadly at Professor
Longworth. Up the river once more sped the racers, the
ludicrous figure of the English professor maintaining its
position behind the principal and never gaining or losing.
The latter was slackening speed a little now, and many fellows
were remarking, “I told you so!” in superior tones.
But Professor Durkee refused to take advantage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
other’s lagging, and as they turned at the flag and headed
back, the watchers saw that the relative positions were still
the same. Down toward the starting point they came
again, and again cheers welcomed them. Professor Wheeler
had plainly overtaxed himself in the first lap and was now
trying to recuperate. He was a very graceful skater, using
a long strike and handling his feet easily and well. Professor
Durkee, on the other hand, possessed no style, kept his body
quite rigid, and took rapid, short strokes. And what, with
his flying coat tails and muffler and his wildly swinging
arms with a red mitten at the extremity of each, he was in
truth a strange and humorous spectacle.</p>

<p>Around the flag they went, the principal still holding
his lead of twenty yards, but looking a bit worried, and the
English professor, his queer old face solemn and inscrutable
under the fur cap, seemingly content to let the other keep
the advantage. It was the last lap now, and as the two
drew away upstream champions of each grew loud and
excited in their claims.</p>

<p>“Why, ‘Wheels’ can leave him at the flag if he wants
to!”</p>

<p>“Course he can. He’s just letting ‘Turkey’ down
easy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, can he? Well, just you wait and see! Why,
‘Wheels’ is done for already; he’s plumb beat!”</p>

<p>And so on, while the contestants reached the farther
end of the course and made the turn. And now the spectators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
thronged the ropes that guarded the finish, cheering
excitedly. Down the ice sped the skaters; a quarter of the
remaining distance was traversed when a shout arose.</p>

<p>“Durkee’s closing up!”</p>

<p>And so he was. His feet were moving so fast over the
frozen surface that they were just a blur to the sight, his
coat tails were flapping gloriously, and he was closing up
the gap! But the principal was yet game, and with a hundred
yards or so still to cover and with Professor Durkee
close behind him he spurted again to the front and had put
several more yards between him and his rival ere the latter
was aware of it. And then—well, then the red mittens
moved so fast hither and thither that they looked like a
streak of fire, the muffler ends stood out straight in the
wind, the coat tails followed suit, the wooden skates bit
and clanged on the ice, the little professor became a small
cyclone, and the watchers held their breaths, too astonished
to even cheer.</p>

<p>Now the coat tails were even with the principal, now
they had passed him and were flapping derisively in his
face, and now they were far beyond reach. And then amid
the delighted acclaim of hundreds “Turkey” crossed the
line like a specially constructed whirlwind and won the
faculty race by a dozen long yards!</p>

<p>This notice was posted on the bulletin board in Academy
Building one morning, and fellows on their way to
recitations read it and became suddenly aware that, from
an athletic standpoint at least, spring had begun. From
that same standpoint winter is a short-lived season in Hillton—a
mere ten weeks between the last football game and
the call for track team candidates; a brief space in which
the hockey players pose as heroes, the Hillton and St. Eustace
chess clubs prepare for and hold their annual contest,
the debating club membership grows, the school librarian
is for once busy all day long, and the juniors conduct
mimic battles and sieges on the green, their citadels and
ammunition both constructed of snow. And then some
morning while the mercury still lingers affectionately about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the zero mark a little square of paper appears on the bulletin
board, and, officially at least, the vernal season is
ushered in.</p>

<p>This year, as usual, with the appearance of the call for
track team candidates a veritable epidemic of athletic enthusiasm
swept over the Academy. The crew candidates,
who for weeks past had been quietly exercising with chest
weights and dumb-bells and running around the track without
occasioning any particular notice, now went to work on
the rowing machines and were daily viewed by a throng
of their fellows. The baseball players congregated in the
cage and pitched and batted and slid about on the canvas
to an accompaniment of low-voiced criticism from chaps
who pressed their noses through the wire meshes for a half-hour
at a time. Golfers polished up their clubs, bought
brand new books on the sport, and were to be found practicing
putting in the dormitory halls. A few lads flocked
together in warm studies and talked of wickets and overs
and bowls, and tried hard to convince themselves and each
other that they were enthusiastic cricketers. And all the
while the ice on the river was thick and hard, the wind
swept across the green in wintry gusts, and the snow was
piled high on either side of the walks.</p>

<p>But if the green and the campus and the frozen paths
were deserted, the gymnasium, especially after two o’clock
in the afternoon, was a busy scene. Of the fifty-odd boys
who reported for the track team, forty-two were put to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
training. With most of them the new work was disappointingly
similar to that gone through with all winter.
The chest weights banged up and down, the rings swung
about under the high roof, the ladders creaked and bent
between their braces, and the dumb-bells and Indian clubs
swung faster than ever. But many of the candidates were
put to work on the wooden track in the hour when twilight
filled the gymnasium with strange and grotesque shadows,
and now and then some candidate for honors with the sixteen-pound
shot was allowed to toss a leather-covered sphere
about the place, to the imminent danger of everybody’s
toes.</p>

<p>Professor Beck, from a quiet, even-voiced, little gentleman,
suddenly became a commanding figure, who was here,
there, and everywhere, and whose least word was like a
trumpet sound. Boys who were not candidates for the
track team or the baseball team or the crew or something—and
there appeared to be few of them in those days—were
not admitted to the floor of the gymnasium after a
certain hour in the afternoon, and so congregated at the
little walled-off inclosure by the entrance and scoffed or
praised, envied or admired, to their heart’s content and to
the despair of the performers.</p>

<p>One afternoon, a few days subsequent to the beginning
of the track candidates’ training, the gymnasium was more
than usually full and noisy. The crew was hard at work
in the rowing room, a half dozen fellows were trotting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
about the track, and the boys under Don were putting in
a preliminary ten minutes at the weights. Taken as a
whole they were a fine-looking lot, though to the uninitiated
many would have appeared too slight in build for
athletic success. These were the sprinters and hurdlers and
those of the new candidates who were desirous of becoming
such. They showed speed rather than strength and
were in some cases slender to a degree. It was not difficult
to distinguish the new candidates from the experienced,
even when they were in gymnasium attire; the matter of
chest development alone afforded unmistakable proof. In
the same way the jumpers and pole vaulters could be picked
out. A greater development of the chest muscles was
noticeable, resultant on the short, sharp effort required in
their work. Of the several boys present who had been
members of the last year’s team as long-distance runners,
three at least indicated their specialty by their build.
Their chests were quite as highly developed as those of
the jumpers, but the development was more general;
their tasks required staying power as well as strength of
lung. Of the performers with the heavy weights, Dave
Merton was a fair example. Both the twelve-pound hammer
and the shot belong of right to athletes who have
weight in their favor, since it is only by putting their
weight into the effort that success with hammer or shot
may be hoped for. The exercise brings into play the muscles
of the back and loins, widens the body across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
shoulders, and gives plenty of room to the heart and lungs.
To a less extent the legs are benefited and the entire muscular
system gains in elasticity.</p>

<p>Professor Beck emerged from the rowing room and
cast his gaze over the gymnasium floor, letting his eyes
rest first on one and then another of the exercisers at the
weights.</p>

<p>“That will do at the weights, boys,” he announced presently.
He referred to a book which he took from his
pocket. “Morris and Graham and Gordon, to the running
track and do a half mile; and by the way, Graham, don’t
labor under the impression that you’re trying to catch a
train; take your pace from Morris. You too, Gordon; you
run too fast. Jumpers and sprinters had better get in
some work with the dumb-bells. I’ll have a look at you
presently. The rest of you know your work, I think.”</p>

<p>He turned to Don, and the two discussed the candidates
for some time, while Wayne joined the men on the track
and proceeded to put twelve laps behind him at a moderate
pace. Wayne’s presence among the track team candidates
requires some explanation. Continued study with but little
outdoor recreation had begun to create a listlessness that
had surprised and worried him. Don, when consulted, explained
the matter in very few words.</p>

<p>“You’ve been cooped up indoors and have had no
exercise; what can you expect? Staying indoors makes a
chap’s brain sluggish. The sooner you take up some exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
that’ll interest you, the sooner you’ll be able to study
well again.”</p>

<p>“But what is there to do?” asked Wayne.</p>

<p>“Why, report on Saturday and try for the track team.
You half promised, anyhow, you know.”</p>

<p>“More dumb-bells?” growled Wayne.</p>

<p>“At first, yes. But when we get outdoors you’ll be
glad that you went in for the team. You’ll like it after
the first week, Wayne. Besides, as a favor to me, you
know!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I just as leave. I don’t mind those chest
weights any more. And I dare say it’ll give me something
to do in spring. And I reckon it <em>would</em> make my lessons
come easier.”</p>

<p>So the name of Wayne Gordon was entered in the list
of candidates for the track team, and he underwent an
examination which appeared satisfactory to Professor Beck
and began training. He was already enjoying the work.
There was a definite object ahead to lend encouragement
at the most trying moments, and even the dumb-bells were
not so monotonous as formerly. Gymnasium work had
already made a perceptible change in the lad. He had got
rid of not a little superfluous flesh since the cross-country
race, and his muscles were firmer, his complexion was
clearer, and he felt better. He even acknowledged this,
somewhat grudgingly, to Don.</p>

<p>“They’re pretty good things—chest weights and dumb-bells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and single sticks—after you get used to ’em,” he
said.</p>

<p>To-day was his second appearance on the running track.
He had discovered the day before, greatly to his surprise,
that he was not expected to race around the building
as fast as his legs would carry him, but that a jog trot was
what pleased Professor Beck best.</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to make any records up there, Gordon,”
the professor had informed him. “If you’re to make
a success at long-distance running you must get off some
of that fat, breathe properly, and learn endurance. Just
put your head back, take long breaths, and jog around
at an even gait. Never mind style; we’ll take that up
later.”</p>

<p>So Wayne jogged. He rather liked it to-day. There
was something soothing in the pat-pat of the runners’ shoes
on the floor. His breath came easily, and as he went around
he could look down occasionally upon the heads of the
fellows below: at Dave who was going through the most
extraordinary antics with a leather-covered shot (Dave
always had recourse to the shot when he could not lay hold
of a hammer); at Don and Professor Beck, the former emphasizing
his words by digging the toe of his gymnasium
shoe into the mattress in front of the vaulting standard;
at a string of fellows at the far side of the building and
under the track who were exercising with the wooden dumb-bells;
at the little group of idle boys at the doorway; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
as he made the turns he could glance through the high
and broad windows and catch glimpses of the frozen river
and far-stretching snow-covered marshes.</p>

<p>Presently Professor Beck and Don parted company, the
latter joining the squad at dumb-bell exercise and the
former fixing the standard for the pole vaulters, two of
whom were soon at work taking low flights. There was
something very attractive about the way in which the two
white-clad and lithe-bodied youngsters gripped the long
poles and rose gracefully into the air to drop noiselessly to
the mattress beyond the crossbar, and Wayne became so
interested in the performance that he forgot to run and
had to be recalled to a recollection of his duty by Morris,
who gave him a playful kick as he jogged by.</p>

<p>But the half mile was soon finished, and Wayne left the
track, descended the stairs, and sought the director, who
was busy instructing Dave and two others in the matter
of holding the shot. After a moment he turned to Wayne.</p>

<p>“How do you feel, Gordon?”</p>

<p>“Fine, sir.”</p>

<p>“Think you could run another half-mile?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“Good; but don’t try it. I guess you’ve done enough
for to-day. Take a tepid shower now and rub yourself
down well with your hands before drying. And, by the
way, let me tell you what I mean by a shower. I don’t
mean that you must turn on the water and stand under it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
until your teeth chatter; but get under it and get out
again—slip through it, as it were. Remember that as
long as you’re in training, Gordon. Too much bathing
is worse than none for weakening you. I don’t mind
telling you that we are going to have need of just such
a runner as I hope you will turn out to be. You’ve got
a little work ahead of you, and there are certain regulations
which may seem a trifle irksome at first; but I hope
you’ll persevere; you’ve got a good incentive to train hard
and conscientiously. And when you get tired or out
of sorts, why, take a rest. You can’t rest too much
when you’re training; only make sure that you are
resting and not loafing. Both Cunningham and I expect
a good deal from you, Gordon; hope you won’t disappoint
us.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try not to, sir, although I haven’t much faith in
myself as an athlete, you know.”</p>

<p>“That’ll come after you’ve done something; of course
it’s all new to you yet, and there’s a good bit to learn, but
I’m sure you’ll make a go of it. And you’ll like it better
when you can get out of doors. Meanwhile don’t overeat,
get a good nine hours of sleep, and don’t let yourself get
tired. And if you want to ask any questions you’ll find me
here, you know.”</p>

<p>Wayne thanked him and disappeared in the direction
of the bathroom. Professor Beck looked after him thoughtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“A good back for running, and endurance written
all over him; and obstinacy, too. It may be,” he mused,
“that we can make use of that obstinacy for a good purpose.
But I hope he doesn’t shy at something or get
balky.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>BENSON MAKES A FIND</small></h2>


<p>“Thought you’d like to know,” explained Dave, as
he mechanically formed a snowball and threw it with precision
at the head of a passing acquaintance.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you told me,” replied Wayne, frowning intently
at the icy path they were traversing on the way
from chapel to breakfast. “I think it’s a mean thing to
do—tell the fellows about it when he hasn’t any proof
against Gray.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I told him I thought he was making an ass of
himself,” concurred Dave. “Benson isn’t a bad sort, you
know, and I guess he really thinks that Gray took the
money; and of course, if he thinks that——”</p>

<p>“But he has no business telling it about school,” declared
Wayne hotly.</p>

<p>“No, he hasn’t. And I don’t believe that Gray took
the old bill. He doesn’t seem that sort, you see. Any fellow
that can fix up second-hand golf balls to look like new
doesn’t steal. Why, Gray remolded those brand new balls
of mine so that they are almost as good as they were before
you lammed them with the fire shovel!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course, Gray isn’t a thief!” said Wayne. “I suppose
the fact of the matter is that Benson just mislaid the
money somewhere and can’t find it. But he has no right
to say that Gray stole it. And I’m going to see him and
tell him so.”</p>

<p>“Good boy! Hope we don’t have hominy this morning.”</p>

<p>Wayne found Benson in his room in Turner at noon.
Benson was a jovial, good-natured chap whom Wayne knew
but slightly. He was in the senior class, though he had
occupied four years in getting there, and was somewhat
of a leader among a coterie of idlers whose aim was to
have as good a time as they could and to pass the examinations
by as narrow a margin as was possible. But there
was nothing vicious about Benson, and Wayne had always
liked him as much as their slight friendship warranted.</p>

<p>“Say, Benson,” Wayne began, as he took a seat on the
edge of the study table, “what’s this about your losing
some money and suspecting Carl Gray of taking it?”</p>

<p>“Why, nothing to make a fuss about,” answered Benson.
“It’s this way. You know you came and asked me
if I had any golf balls that needed fixing up, and I said I
had. And the next day this fellow Gray came and got
them. And then a couple of weeks later he turned up one
day when I was sitting here and brought them back. I’d
just got a letter from my aunt, and the old lady had inclosed
a two-dollar bill. That’s a way she has, bless her! The
bill was laying on the table near you there. I was reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
a library book—Ploetz’s Epitome of Universal History, it
was—and so when Gray came in I just told him to lay the
balls on the table and said I’d pay him the next day; I owed
him sixty cents, and didn’t have any change. Gray said all
right and he hoped I’d like the balls, and went out. Then
afterward I looked for the bill and it wasn’t there. Maybe
he didn’t take it,” concluded Benson good-naturedly, “but
it wasn’t to be found, and so I naturally suspected him.”</p>

<p>“But Carl Gray isn’t a thief, confound you, Benson!”</p>

<p>“Well, I dare say he didn’t take it. It doesn’t matter.
But you said yourself that he was awfully hard up for
money, you know, Gordon; and I thought that perhaps he
saw the bill and concluded he needed it more than I did.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you really think that Gray took the money
I’ll pay it back to you myself. Only you’ve got to keep
your mouth shut, Benson, and not go telling it all around
school. Why, hang it, it’s a shame to say such a thing
about a fellow unless you can prove it!”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t been telling it all around school,” said
Benson indignantly. “I haven’t told a soul except Dick
Barrow.”</p>

<p>“Well, Barrow’s told everybody else, I reckon. I
learned it from Dave Merton this morning. You ought to
know that if you tell a thing like that it’s sure to get
around.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry, Gordon. I didn’t mean to be nasty
about it. Besides, I don’t care about the two dollars. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
dear old lady has sent another two since then—this very
morning, in fact. I’ll tell the fellows that it’s all a lie;
Barrow’s an awful liar anyhow, you know.”</p>

<p>“I think you’d ought to hunt for the money,” responded
Wayne.</p>

<p>“Hunt? I have hunted, Gordon. I hunted all through
the room the day it disappeared.”</p>

<p>“Well, I know that Gray didn’t steal it. But I’m
going to pay it back to you.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re not, Gordon. I don’t want your money.
If Gray didn’t take it you’ve no business paying it to me;
and if he did take it, I don’t see where you come in. Hang
it, I said I didn’t want the money. What’s the good of
fussing about it?”</p>

<p>“Lots of good,” replied Wayne angrily. “You’ve
spread a report that Carl Gray stole the money from you.
You’d no business doing that, and you know it. I’m going
to pay the two dollars to you so that you’ll shut up.”</p>

<p>“I’ve told you that I didn’t spread any report; I only
told one fellow. And I had a right to tell him if I
wanted to.”</p>

<p>“Why haven’t you accused Gray to his face?”</p>

<p>“I will if you send him up.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t, either. You’ve done enough harm
already with your old two-dollar bill. If you’re halfways
decent you’ll try and stop the story from getting around
any more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“I like your cheek, Gordon,” answered Benson, slamming
a book down on the table. “If I’ve made a mistake
in mentioning the thing to Barrow I’m sorry, and I’ll deny
the story whenever I hear it; I can’t do any more than
that, can I?”</p>

<p>“But what did you do it for?” insisted Wayne.</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve explained it, haven’t I? What’s the good
of talking about it any more? If the money was stolen,
it’s stolen, and——”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t stolen, and you know it, Benson.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything of the sort,” responded Benson,
losing his temper. “I only know that you tell me Gray
isn’t a thief; maybe he isn’t. But the money was there
when he came in and it was gone when he went out; and he
wanted money. If you’ve got anything else to say, say it
to Gray.”</p>

<p>“You’re a coward, Benson, to make such a charge when
you can’t——”</p>

<p>“Well, on my word! Say, you’d better get out of
here, or——”</p>

<p>“Or what?” asked Wayne defiantly.</p>

<p>Benson restrained himself with an effort and walked to
the window.</p>

<p>“If you don’t I will, and you can talk to the
table.”</p>

<p>Wayne bit his lip, scowled at the motionless back of
the other boy, and slid to the floor. At the door he hesitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
with his hand on the knob. Then he returned to the
middle of the study.</p>

<p>“I say, Benson, I’ll take that back, you know—what
I just said. I reckon I’ve been acting like a cad ever
since I came in; but you see Gray’s a friend of mine,
and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right; no harm done. Of course you’d
feel mad about it; I dare say I would in your place. Sorry
I ever opened my mouth on the subject.” Benson turned
back toward the table and smiled good-humoredly. “If
you hear the yarn again you might deny it for me. Will
you? Just say I was lying, you know.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll find the money some time,” suggested
Wayne.</p>

<p>“Eh? Find the money? Oh, of course I might.
Still—” Benson paused and stared at Wayne. Then his
face lighted up. “By Jove, Gordon, that’s a good idea!
I’ll find it this evening!”</p>

<p>“Yes; it might have fallen into a drawer or somewhere
like that, you know.”</p>

<p>“Of course it might. I—I dare say it fell back of the
drawer. Perhaps it’s there now, Gordon.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is.”</p>

<p>Very seriously Benson, fumbling in his vest pocket,
advanced to the table and pulled out the left-hand drawer.
Then he thrust his hand into the aperture.</p>

<p>“Feel anything?” asked Wayne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I think I’ve got it.” He withdrew his hand and
held up a two-dollar bill. “Isn’t that luck?”</p>

<p>“Yes indeed,” replied Wayne unsmilingly. “And
I’m awfully glad you found it. I’ll tell Merton, and get
him to tell the others.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would. And I’ll tell Barrow right away.
I suppose I put it into the drawer and forgot about it, and
then it got pushed out at the back. I should think that
was the way it happened, eh?”</p>

<p>“Must be,” answered Wayne. “Well, I’ll get out
now. Awfully much obliged to you, Benson, for—for hunting
it. And I hope you’ll forget anything I said that
wasn’t——”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Gordon; forget it yourself. Glad
you came in.”</p>

<p>Wayne hurried away to his room for a book, and on
the way he pondered over Benson’s story. Of course, Benson
might have been mistaken, but Wayne couldn’t blame
him in his heart for suspecting Gray, under the circumstances.
Had Gray really taken the money? He <em>was</em>
hard up at the time, undoubtedly; and perhaps the temptation
had been too great for him. On the other hand, Carl
Gray didn’t look like a fellow that would give way to
temptation so easily, and he had kept every promise made
to him. No, Gray hadn’t taken the money, Wayne concluded,
and he hoped that the story would not reach his
ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>But it had. Gray was sitting in Wayne’s easy-chair
talking to Don when Wayne reached the study, and after
the latter had found his chemistry notebook Gray accompanied
him across the yard. He broached the subject at
once. He had heard the report in a roundabout way, and
scarcely knew whether to credit it or not.</p>

<p>“I’m very sure, Gordon,” the boy declared, “that
there wasn’t any money near me when I was in his room
that time. I laid the golf balls on the table; I should have
noticed a bill if it had been in sight. I didn’t take the
money, Gordon, honestly! Won’t you go with me to see
Benson? You could tell him that—that—well, you know
me a little. Why, if the faculty hears of it——”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” cried Wayne, who for several minutes had
been trying to interrupt the flow of the other’s nervous explanations
and protestations. “The money wasn’t stolen.
It’s been found. Benson found it himself. It had fallen
out back of the table drawer. I was there when he
found it.”</p>

<p>“Really?” cried Gray. “I—I’m awfully glad!”</p>

<p>“Benson didn’t mean the story to get out. You see,
Gray, he thought he had left the money on the table, and
when he went to look for it after you’d gone he couldn’t
find it. He hunted everywhere—as he thought—and—and
it didn’t turn up. And then he—he suspected you. I
told him he was mistaken, and so we hunted some more,
and he found it in the table, you know. I wouldn’t worry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
about it. I don’t believe many fellows heard it. And
he’s going to tell all of them that the money is found,
and so am I. He’s very sorry about it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t suppose he was to blame. Of course, he—he
didn’t know me very well. It was good of you to
see him, awfully good. Why, perhaps if you hadn’t gone
there he wouldn’t have found it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he would have, some time. But I’m glad I
went. Well, here’s where I do stunts with chemistry.”</p>

<p>“You’re—you’re quite sure it was found, Gordon?”
asked Gray as Wayne ran up the steps. “You’re not just
saying that to make me feel better?”</p>

<p>“Of course it was found,” cried Wayne. “Didn’t I
tell you that I saw Benson find it, you chump?” Gray
turned away, apparently not quite convinced, and Wayne
went on into the hall.</p>

<p>“My!” he muttered with a grin, “I’m getting to be
an awful liar!” He frowned over some obtruding thought.
Then he pushed open the recitation-room door with a violence
that won him a scowl of annoyance from the professor.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” he told himself, as he took his seat and
opened his book; “Gray <em>didn’t</em> take it!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>WAYNE RAISES A FLAG</small></h2>


<p>March came in like a lion that spring and roared and
raved over the river and about the dormitories and made
life out of doors a hardship that few cared to brave. Ere
it was a week old it had piled the ice in walls along the
river banks, swept the green bare of snow, and snapped
the tall flag post in front of Academy Building. Wayne
and Don hugged the fireplace when not at recitations or in
the gymnasium, and got a lot of studying done. Wayne’s
ability to learn his lessons had increased of late, and he was
ready to give credit to Professor Beck and the steady training
he was undergoing. Physical exercise clears the brain,
and Wayne discovered an improvement before he had been
at work with the track squad for two weeks. He even
began to speak tentatively of trying for a scholarship, and
Don grinned and cunningly encouraged him by saying:</p>

<p>“Oh, well, you can try, of course. But I don’t believe
you can make it. You won’t stick to it long enough; you’ll
get tired of studying after a while.”</p>

<p>An assertion which Wayne indignantly denied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just you wait and see! You needn’t think you and
Paddy are the only fellows in school who can get scholarships!”</p>

<p>Gymnasium work was much the same as it had been
since Don and Wayne went into training; there was always
the chest weights and the dumb-bells, and Wayne knew
every splinter and crack in the running track by this time.
But he had dropped two or three pounds of weight, and felt
better for it; he had made the acquaintance of a number
of the candidates who were the sort of chaps that it was
well to know; he had secured a new interest in school life,
and he was able to talk more or less intelligently with Don
upon subjects that occupied full half of that youth’s
thought—namely, the approaching spring handicap meet
and the more distant interscholastic contest. Don had
thrown himself heart and soul into the task of turning out a
winning track team, and, being a youth who was willing
and eager to back his mental efforts with the hardest sort
of physical labor, he was in a fair way to succeed. For two
weeks past he had been in correspondence with a number
of Hillton graduates, and now he was able to announce that
he had secured promises of active assistance from almost
all of them, and that the track men would not want for
coaching.</p>

<p>“Barret is coming in April,” he told Wayne one day.
“He was a star hurdler at college a couple of years ago.
Then Kenyon, who holds the intercollegiate two-hundred-and-twenty-yard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
record, and Burns, who won the one hundred
yards last spring, are both coming to coach the
sprinters. Remsen, the old football coach, is coming, and
I think he’ll be willing to teach Dave and Hardy and
Kendall a few tricks with the weights. We need a middle-distance
man and some one who knows something
about pole vaulting. Johnstone may come; he’s half
promised. As for you and Chase and Treadway and the
rest, why, Beck will look after you; he’s a dandy coach
for the distances; he used to be a fine runner in the
mile, and held the intercollegiate championship for a
couple of seasons. We’ll be well fixed for coaches this
spring.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me with all those men to help,” said Wayne,
“we can’t help winning.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t follow. You see, St. Eustace and the other
schools will have just as many good grads coaching them.
St. Eustace generally has a whole army of them. That’s
one bully thing about that school: you never hear of it
begging for aid of any sort from the alumni; the alumni’s
always on hand and waiting to help. Of course, I don’t
mean that Hillton graduates aren’t like that, only—well,
sometimes they seem a bit backward in coming forward.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Wayne; “perhaps if the truth
was known we’d find that St. Eustace captains have just
as much trouble getting the old fellows to go there and
coach as you have had. I know from what Dave told me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
once that Hillton fellows always help the school all they
know how.”</p>

<p>“Good for you!” answered Don, with a grin. “’Rah
for Hillton!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much; only that you are coming on. I think
I can detect symptoms of patriotism, Wayne.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! Of course a fellow always stands up for his
school; he’d be mighty poor trash if he didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear you say so,” responded Don dryly. “You
didn’t seem to be impressed with that fact when you first
arrived in our midst with your two trunks and an air of
supreme importance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” growled Wayne. Don smiled silently,
as though at an amusing thought, and Wayne observed him
with rather an embarrassed expression. Finally he broke
the silence.</p>

<p>“Stop grinning there like a chloroformed catfish, Don!
I suppose I was rather a silly ass when I got here.
But, you see, I hadn’t been away from our little old village
very much and didn’t know a great deal about
boarding schools.” He paused and looked reminiscently
into the flames. “You and Dave and Paddy were
awfully nice to me. I must have seemed a powerful sulky
brute!”</p>

<p>“Well, you were a bit exasperating at first with your
high and mighty views of the school and the fellows and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the way in which we conducted things here at Hillton.
But we all kind of took to you the first day; perhaps that
was the reason. I’ll never forget the afternoon you walked
in here, plumped your valise down, and asked why the
nigger hadn’t lighted the fire!”</p>

<p>“But it was chilly,” objected Wayne.</p>

<p>“And when I explained very respectfully that you
would be obliged to share the study with me, you looked me
over very condescendingly and remarked: ‘Well, I reckon
it’s the rule; but seems to me they might have told me
that.’”</p>

<p>“Did I say that?” asked Wayne meekly.</p>

<p>“Every word. And I don’t mind acknowledging now
that I was sorely tempted to knock your head against the
wall.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you didn’t. Because if you had we
wouldn’t have been chums. But I wonder why you didn’t
kick and get another roommate?”</p>

<p>“That’s the funny part of it, Wayne. I suppose I must
have liked you even then. By the way, do you remember
how mad you got one day when Paddy told you that you
spoke with a ‘refined negro dialect’?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Wayne, “I remember. Well, I’m
glad I’ve learned a little sense since then. I felt powerful
mean and homesick the first few weeks I was here; and
you and Paddy and Dave were awfully decent to me. It
isn’t the thing that a fellow talks about, of course, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
hate to have any one get ‘sloppy,’ but, honest, Don, I
won’t forget it, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, quit your joking!” cried Don, jumping up.
“Let’s go over to Hampton and bother Dave.”</p>

<p>So they struggled into their sweaters and went. The
sound of hammering and shouting aroused their curiosity,
and they made a detour to the front of Academy Building
to learn the meaning of the noise. A group of workmen
were putting the finishing touches on the new flagstaff,
and already it reared its length aloft on the edge of the
bluff, the glistening gold ball at the top of the slender mast
shining bright against the gray sky.</p>

<p>“Phew!” exclaimed Don. “She’s a tall old stick,
isn’t she? Must be a good fifty feet, eh?”</p>

<p>“Worse than that,” answered Wayne. “I should say
about sixty.”</p>

<p>“Maybe. I wonder if they’ll get a new flag. The
old one’s pretty well worn out.”</p>

<p>“Say, Don,” Wayne suggested as they hurried on toward
Hampton House with their ears tingling, “wouldn’t
it be a grand joke to run a flag up there to-night ourselves?
Think how surprised ‘Wheels’ would be in the
morning!”</p>

<p>“By Jove! Great scheme. Come on; let’s tell Paddy
and Dave.”</p>

<p>Those young gentlemen hailed the idea with glee, and
called Wayne a public benefactor and many other flattering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
things. The fact was, life had been deadly dull of late,
and the continued indoor existence was beginning to affect
their spirits. The idea of having a flag raising of their
own appeared illumined with brilliance, and the quartet
at once began arrangements.</p>

<p>“But we haven’t a flag,” objected Dave.</p>

<p>“Let’s make one. It ought to be something more
startling than the Stars and Stripes,” said Paddy. “I wish
we had a class flag. I tell you, fellows, let’s run up a skull
and crossbones!”</p>

<p>“Just the thing!” giggled Wayne. “Where’ll we
get it?”</p>

<p>“Have to make it. Dave’s got some black paint stuff,
and we’ll use a sheet or something.”</p>

<p>“Pillowcase would be better,” said Don. “Rip it
open, you know.”</p>

<p>“Splendid! We’ll use Dave’s.”</p>

<p>“Use your own,” responded Dave. “If I supply the
paint you’d ought to supply the pillowcase.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right, stingy. Get your paint stuff.”</p>

<p>Paddy’s pillow case was quickly produced and ripped
at the seams, and the four boys squatted about it on the
floor, while Don drew a skull—at least, he declared it was
that—and a pair of very stout bones beneath it. Then
Wayne, claiming the right by virtue of the origination of
the idea, filled in the design with some extremely sticky
varnish, and the flag was complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s not black at all; it’s sort of brownish,” Wayne
objected.</p>

<p>“Well, bones aren’t black, anyway,” said Don. “Besides,
it shows up finely. Now how’ll we get it up
there?”</p>

<p>Plans were discussed until supper time, and at length
it was decided to go and have a look at the pole and the
halyards on the way to the dining hall. This was done. The
workmen had departed, the new ropes were flapping sharply
against the pole, and the boys found everything ready for
them. They didn’t linger there, for fear that they would
be observed and connected with the affair the next day,
but went on to supper, agreeing to meet in Hampton at
nine o’clock.</p>

<p>At a few minutes past that hour four muffled and mysterious
figures scuttled across the yard, keeping in the
shelter of the laboratories and the gymnasium, and gathered
about the flag pole. Detection was out of the question,
for the night was as dark as the most desperate mission
could demand. Above them the topmast creaked complainingly
in the wind and the halyards beat a tattoo against
the wood. Very quickly the new flag was attached, Paddy
complaining <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">sotto voce</i> because the varnish stuck to his
hands, and Wayne laid hold of the other rope.</p>

<p>“Hats off!” commanded Don in a husky whisper.</p>

<p>Four cloth caps left as many heads bare to the cold
wind, Dave whistled a lugubrious march beneath his breath,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and Wayne ran the flag upward into the darkness and the
teeth of the March tempest.</p>

<p>“Hold on,” whispered Paddy. “Pull it down again!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked the others.</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you see, they can get it down! Shall we
allow our flag to be lowered? Never! So let’s cut the rope
that the pillowcase is on. Then they’ll have nothing to
lower it with!”</p>

<p>The others studied the problem a moment in silence.
Then, “Well that sounds reasonable,” muttered Wayne.
“Let’s try it anyway.” So the flag came down, and Paddy
cut the halyards a few inches beneath it. Then the skull
and crossbones was again hoisted, this time with scant ceremony,
the severed length of rope was stuffed under Paddy’s
jacket, and the four conspirators parted with muffled laughter.
Above them in the wind-swept space the ominous
standard flapped in the darkness.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>AND LOWERS IT</small></h2>


<p>What a commotion there was the next day!</p>

<p>Wayne and Don found the flag pole surrounded by a
throng of delighted and amazed youths when they wandered
unostentatiously to the front of the Academy Building on
their way to chapel. What a chattering there was!
Juniors hinted proudly that they knew more about it than
they were inclined to impart, and that when it came to
pure and artistic pranks their class “was really the only
one, you know!” The lower middle fellows accepted the
presence of the fluttering white banner with its derisive
and unlovely emblem as a direct challenge from the juniors,
and there was much talk of “punched heads.” The upper
middle fellows asserted positively that it was the work of a
certain secret society which, despite the rules, had to their
knowledge been flourishing at Hillton for many years. The
seniors—well, the seniors acted like all seniors. They
viewed the flag with secret gusto and outward disgust and
talked about “disgrace to the school” and “finding the
fellows that did it, by Jove!” And Wayne and Don and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Paddy and Dave, loud in expressions of surprise and condemnation,
mingled with the throng and laughed in their
sleeves.</p>

<p>Then every one ran for chapel and listened impatiently
for the faculty’s expression of its views on the subject.
They were not disappointed. When the time for announcements
came, the principal disposed of the minor affairs with
his usual tranquillity, and then took up the subject of the
flag. Wayne and Don, Paddy and Dave, sitting together at
the back of the hall, experienced a distinct sense of disappointment.
Instead of taking the appearance of the skull
and crossbones as a thing demanding censure and threats
of expulsion, the principal ridiculed their splendid effort!</p>

<p>“I presume,” he remarked without any evidence of
feeling, “that it is the work of some junior. It could
scarcely be anything else. The trick is so little and silly
that none but a very young and mistaken boy would have
thought of it. Whoever put the flag up there arranged
matters so that it can not be pulled down. It would be
possible for us to have the topmast lowered, but as that
would necessitate a large expense we shall not do it. So
the flag will, of course, continue to fly there, a very fitting
symbol of the school’s idea of humor, until the wind whips
it to pieces. It may be that it will bring a certain amount
of ridicule on the Academy, and the sight of it may arouse
sensations of disgust in the breasts of sensible boys, but
there is no help for it. The faculty will take no steps to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
discover the author or authors of the silly trick, and they
will not have the satisfaction of knowing themselves to be
offenders against the school authority. They are in no
danger of the slightest punishment; I do not even ask
them to own up to the affair or offer apologies. The incident
is closed so far as the faculty is concerned. It would,
however, have been more appropriate had the design on
the flag been a donkey’s head; but it’s too late to change it
now.”</p>

<p>The four conspirators walked out of chapel in a silence
that held them until they parted at the steps of Warren
Hall. Then Dave spoke:</p>

<p>“Smart, weren’t we?”</p>

<p>There was no reply, and the four went into breakfast
feeling, as Paddy afterward put it, “like excommunicated
angels.” Wayne was very silent during the forenoon and
only scowled at every effort of his friends to engage him
in conversation. The juniors posted a notice immediately
after breakfast calling for a meeting in Society House in
the evening; and the example was quickly followed by the
other three classes. Indignation ran high. The humor had
departed from the affair, and the prospect of having the
skull and crossbones fly in front of Academy Building during
the rest of the school year was most unwelcome. The
four perpetrators of the trick felt this as keenly as any.</p>

<p>“It’s got to come down,” said Wayne doggedly, when
the four congregated in 15 Bradley after lunch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, how’s it coming down?” asked Paddy.</p>

<p>“We were awful asses,” said Don disgustedly.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t exactly our fault,” answered Dave. “If
‘Wheels’ had only been decent about it! But what can
you do if faculty won’t take your efforts toward enlivenment
in the proper spirit?”</p>

<p>“Has any one tried to get the old thing down?” questioned
Paddy.</p>

<p>“Yes, lots of fellows have tried. Wayne pulled the
flag so far up that a corner of it’s fast in the pulley arrangement,”
responded Don. “If he hadn’t been so keen to
overdo the thing——”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up! What’s the good of blaming Wayne.
We were all in it equally,” said Paddy.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so,” admitted Don. “Let’s try and think
of a way of getting the bloody thing down.”</p>

<p>“Bony thing,” corrected Dave.</p>

<p>“Look here, fellows, I got the thing up there—it was
my idea in the first place—and I’ll get it down again.”
Wayne scowled around the little circle. “All I want you
fellows to do is to quit nagging. Who knows where I can
get a boat hook?”</p>

<p>“There’s slathers of ’em in the boathouse,” said Paddy.</p>

<p>“Well, you get me one—a real light one. I’ll borrow
Moore’s climbing irons, and after laboratory work I’ll have
a try at it.”</p>

<p>“Can you climb?” asked Don doubtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“Some,” answered Wayne. “There are spikes in the
pole up as far as the crosstree. After that I’ll use the
climbing irons as far as I can, and then shin the rest of the
way.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see what you want a boat hook for,” said
Dave.</p>

<p>“To get hold of the flag, of course. It’s stuck in the
block. If I can get the hook in it I reckon I can pull it
free.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. Well, you might try.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we ought to let him try,” said Don
anxiously. “It’s an awful long way to the top of the thing,
and it’s blowing a gale. At any rate, Wayne, you’d better
wait until to-morrow. The wind might blow you off.”</p>

<p>“No, it’s got to be done to-day. We don’t want to
attend the class meeting this evening and have to get up
and tell the fellows that we did it and we’re awfully sorry,
do we? We’d look like idiots! No, I’ll try it this afternoon,
wind or no wind.”</p>

<p>“Well, look here,” exclaimed Paddy, “I was in this as
much as you were, Wayne, and I’m stronger than you,
and if anybody is going to climb that pole it’s going to
be me!”</p>

<p>“No, I put it up; it was my scheme,” answered Wayne
stubbornly. “I’ll get it down.”</p>

<p>Paddy’s remonstrances were of no avail, and the others
at last gave their consent to the undertaking. Paddy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
promised to get the boat hook, and they agreed to meet at
four o’clock and try to undo their work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Paddy’s appearance at the flag pole armed with the
boat hook and Wayne’s advent there with a pair of climbing
irons over his arm was sufficient to draw a crowd, and
soon the vicinity was thronged with curious watchers, who
danced about in an endeavor to keep their feet warm or
sought shelter from the cold blasts in the doorway of Academy
Building. Dave and Don soon arrived, and the latter
viewed with apprehension the task ahead of his chum. Far
up in the air the white banner bearing the ridiculous skull
and crossbones fluttered and whipped in the wind as though
quite as much ashamed of its appearance as were the boys,
and resolved to put an end to its luckless career with every
convulsive tug at its lashings.</p>

<p>“I do wish Wayne wouldn’t try to climb up there,”
muttered Don in Dave’s ear; but Dave was explaining
the proceedings with great gusto to “Pigeon” Wallace, and
so didn’t hear him. Wayne himself was strapping the irons
to his stout shoes, and Paddy, looking as though he wished
himself well out of the whole affair, stood by with the
boat hook, to which a length of rope had been attached.
Through the audience sped the startling information of
Wayne Gordon’s contemplated adventure, and a murmur
of excited interest arose; and boys who had absent friends
sped away in search of them. As Wayne took his gloves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
off and put his foot on the first of the spikes that rendered
more or less easy the ascent of the lower pole a wholly impromptu
cheer arose and gained in volume until it resolved
itself into a loud “’Rah—’rah—’rah, Gordon!”</p>

<p>Wayne paid no heed; he was already halfway up the
great white-painted mast that terminated many feet above
in a broad crosstree. It was easy going, save for the wind
and the fact that the climbing irons interfered when he laid
his feet on the rests. But the crosstree was quickly
reached, and he pulled himself on to it, and clutching the
topmast with his left arm, with the other pulled up the
boat hook by means of the rope, one end of which was tied
around his waist. Those below saw that after one fleeting
downward glance he raised his eyes and did not again risk
dizziness.</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Paddy, his head craned back as he
gazed aloft. “See how the wind blows up there!”</p>

<p>“Is there any danger of the thing breaking?” asked
Dave.</p>

<p>“Not a bit. It’s a nice new pine, and it’ll stand lots.
But if Wayne gets up there and loses his grip— Say, I
wish we hadn’t let him do it!” Paddy looked with troubled
eyes into Don’s pale countenance.</p>

<p>“Here comes the whole blamed faculty!” cried Dave,
and as the group of boys turned to look Professor Wheeler,
accompanied by “Turkey” and Longworth, pushed into
the assemblage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who is that up there?” the principal asked sternly.</p>

<p>“Wayne Gordon, sir,” answered a dozen voices.</p>

<p>“Gordon! <em>Gordon!</em>” The principal made a trumpet
of his hands and shouted at the top of his lungs. “Come
down at once!”</p>

<p>There was no answer from the figure on the crosstree.
Possibly the wind was too strong to allow of the principal’s
voice reaching him; possibly Wayne heard, but thought
the command issued from one of the fellows. At all events
his only response was to seize the slender topmast with his
arms, dig his climbing irons into the wood, and start upward.
The principal again shouted.</p>

<p>“Best let him alone, sir,” said Professor Durkee calmly.
“I doubt if he can hear; but if he can ’twill only bother
him and make the task more hazardous.” The principal
turned sternly to the throng about the pole.</p>

<p>“Did none of you know better than to let him do this?
Is that you there, Cunningham? I should have thought
that you, for one, would have stopped him!”</p>

<p>There was no reply from the throng, and Don accepted
the rebuke with a miserable countenance. It was Paddy
who ventured a defense.</p>

<p>“He would go, sir. Nobody can stop Gordon when he
makes up his mind, sir.” The principal’s only answer was
a gesture of exasperation. Then all eyes were turned upward
again.</p>

<p>Wayne had reached a place where, because of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
slenderness of the pole, his irons were of no further use.
To take them off was a difficult task, but to keep them on
rendered farther progress well-nigh impossible. So he
drove the spike on his right foot deep into the mast and
unbuckled his left iron and threw it far out beyond the
edge of the crowd below. Clinging to the pole with his
legs and his left arm, he managed at last to undo the remaining
iron and kick his foot free from the straps. Then
he wound both legs about the mast, gripped it firmly with
his hands, and began to shin upward again. He wished that
he had left his shoes at the crosstree, for his stockinged feet
would have gripped the wood much closer. But it was too
late to think of that. The wind and the exertion had almost
deprived him of breath, and now, as he reached a point some
twenty feet above the crosstree, the topmast began to get
woefully slim and swayed sickeningly in the wind. For an
instant he stopped climbing and clung motionless. To the
watchers below it seemed that he must be about to give up.
The mast looked scarcely larger round than one’s arm, and
the boy’s figure, a dark atom against the sullen gray of the
flying clouds, swayed from side to side perilously.</p>

<p>But Wayne had no thought of giving up. He only
paused a moment to gather breath for further effort and
then went on, his feet, legs, and arms gripping the rocking
pole with all their strength. One circumstance aided him:
the mast had been varnished but a few days before, and
presented to his hands a slightly sticky surface that made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
his grip surer and easier. He feared but one thing, and
that was a look downward. He strove with all his might
against the irresistible temptation to let his gaze drop for
just a fraction of a second; he knew that if he yielded vertigo
would master him. So far he had been successful, but
now, with his task almost accomplished, the golden ball but
a few feet above him, something seemingly stronger than
his will forced him to lower his head. He stopped climbing
again and, with despair at his heart, clung tightly to
the swaying mast. His eyes dropped to the roof of the
neighboring laboratories, to the ice-covered walk that led
to Academy Building, to the edge of the throng!</p>

<p>A murmur of dismay and apprehension crept through
the crowd. For a moment the March tempest was stilled,
and in that moment, faint, and as though from a great distance,
came a cry from below:</p>

<p>“<em>Keep agoing, Old Virginia!</em>”</p>

<p>Wayne recognized Paddy’s deep voice. With a rush
the blood drove back to the boy’s chilled heart. He gave a
gasp, threw back his head, and found himself staring at the
golden ball, which, for the first time, seemed to beckon him
upward. Arms and legs responded strongly to his demand,
and inch by inch the remaining distance was won.</p>

<p>Some five feet from the swaying tip he again paused
and gripped the mast, now scarcely more than a rod, and
again hauled up the boat hook. The skull and crossbones
flared and snapped loudly and derisively. Taking a firm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
hold of the mast with his left hand, he reached forward the
long shaft. The first effort drove the hook through a corner
of the white cloth; the first tug freed it from the pulley
block, and with a rush the hook and flag came down. But
Wayne was careful not to let the former drop. Holding it
firmly, he started to descend, the flag following. And from
the throng below broke a cheer that was quickly hushed
lest it confuse the boy. But the rest was simple and the
crosstree was quickly gained. The wind, as though angry
at having been deprived of its seeming prey, lashed and
whirled at him as he dropped easily and quickly from one
foot rest to another. A few feet from the ground the boy
paused and detached the flag from the rope. Then he
stepped down into the throng. A dozen pairs of arms were
outstretched to him and a rousing cheer went up. Don,
pale and trembling, thrust himself through the crowd
roughly and threw one arm around his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Wayne!” he whispered huskily.</p>

<p>Wayne smiled lightly back at him and pushed forward.
He met a glance of sly understanding from Professor Durkee’s
little gray eyes and a nod of approval. Then the
principal was speaking.</p>

<p>“That was bravely done, Gordon, and we owe you
thanks. But don’t try anything of the sort again.”</p>

<p>Wayne met the principal’s grave eyes and grinned.</p>

<p>“I won’t, sir. But nobody owes any thanks. You see,
I put it up there!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>ON THE CINDER TRACK</small></h2>


<p>One morning in late March the earth awoke to find
that during the night a little south wind had melted the
last vestige of ice and snow in the shaded corners, and that
Spring was busy cleansing the land ere beginning her housekeeping.
The gravel walks were soft underfoot and little
blue ribbons of water trickled across them. The willows in
the meadow at the base of the hill had suddenly put on
their vernal costume of tender russet, and the campus, a
veritable quagmire for the nonce, was doffing its faded
livery, and, to the close observer, revealing in favored
hollows and sheltered slopes a garb of soft green velvet.
Along the station road the thrush proclaimed its pleasure
at the new order of things in clear, sweet notes that
trembled in the soft air like intangible sunflecks. The
river rehearsed in gentle murmurs a new song as it rippled
past island and point, and reflected on its bright surface
the tender blue of the sky and the fleecy whiteness of the
slowly sailing clouds. Spring had come in the valley of the
Hudson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>And never was spring more welcome. The winter had
been severe and protracted, and to youth and health the
enforced captivity indoors had long since grown irksome.
Suddenly the boathouse became the scene of much activity
and the two crews took to the water with all the delight
of young ducks, and the sound of oars and of the coxswains’
voices floated up from the river every afternoon. Baseballs
and bats made their appearance and swept through the
school like an epidemic. The campus became the center of
Academy life, and the golf links was dotted with enthusiastic
players. As soon as the cinder track had dried sufficiently
Professor Beck and his charges took possession, and
outdoor training began with spirit.</p>

<p>The winter term came to an end, and spring vacation
depopulated the school for the better part of a week. Don
and Paddy both went home for an “over Sunday” visit,
the former’s duties as captain of the track team precluding
a more extended absence, and the latter’s dislike to be
away from Dave for any length of time causing him to cut
his presence in the bosom of his family to the shortest possible
length. Dave stayed at Hillton and Wayne kept him
company. Both kept up their training about as they would
have done had no vacation been in progress. Wayne had
now attained to a development of lung power that satisfied
even Professor Beck, and his triweekly performances
on the gymnasium running track had given place to almost
daily walks over the country roads or across fields; often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
there was a little cross-country run participated in by
Wayne and others. No effort was made to cover the distance
quickly, and the instructions were to avoid hard running;
so the lads trotted easily over a two-mile course in
a bunch and had plenty of fun at the hazards, and came
puffing up to the gymnasium together with reddened cheeks
and tingling bodies to undergo the delights of a shower bath
and a subsequent rubbing down that sent them to supper
with the appetites of young bears.</p>

<p>But with the commencement of the spring term the
walks were superseded by almost daily work on the track.
The cross-country trips became regular events for the first
and latter part of the week, and were varied in distance
from time to time. Often Wayne was the only one of the
“milers” or “half milers” to take the run; sometimes he
was accompanied by Whitehead, a promising junior class
youth; and less often the entire group of candidates were
out. But whether the others were sent across the fields or
not, Wayne was never allowed to miss a run.</p>

<p>“You see, Gordon,” Professor Beck explained one day,
“we have a way of classing fellows into three temperaments—the
sanguine, the bilious, and the lymphatic; often
the classification is difficult to make, but in your case it is
extremely easy. You belong in the bilious class; constitution
tough and capable of severe tasks and prolonged effort;
circulation sluggish; disposition naturally persevering and
ob—ahem!—inflexible; requires plenty of good food and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
lots of exercise. You and Whitehead are the only distance
men that I can rightly class as bilious; Whitehead
is less so than you; there is also something of the sanguine
in his make-up. So, my boy, that is why I keep you tussling
with cross-country work while the others are on the
track. No two men or boys, dogs or horses, require the
same training in every particular. Your friend Cunningham
is rather of a sanguine disposition; he’s a brilliant performer
at whatever he takes hold of; he can go over the
one-hundred-and-twenty-yard hurdles in the finest form;
but if he tried to take an oar in a two-mile boat race he
would in all probability slump in his work before the race
was won. The sanguine man is a man of dash and spirit,
and is, as a rule, incapable of prolonged effort; he makes
a good sprinter, but a poor long-distance runner.”</p>

<p>“But Don is a good cross-country runner,” objected
Wayne.</p>

<p>“No, he’s not; that is, he’s a good cross-country runner
for the reason that he is an excellent jumper and hurdler,
and makes up by his speed over obstacles what he loses on
the flat; but he’s only a fair cross-country man because he
is worn out at the end of the second mile; after that, to the
finish, he has to depend on nerve and ‘sand.’ Two years
ago he managed to finish second, how I scarcely know.
This last fall, of the four men who finished first, three were
distinctly of a bilious temperament, and one, Northrop,
fairly lymphatic. Of course, to this, as to all other rules,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
there are exceptions; but it’s a rule that holds generally
true. To the sanguine temperament we look for speed, to
the bilious for endurance, to the lymphatic for nerve.”</p>

<p>On the days when the cross-country run was not in
order Wayne went with the other fellows to the track and
practiced starting, and afterward ran varying distances on
the cinders. The latter work Wayne liked, for, although
he had not as yet been allowed to go over three fourths of
a mile, and though Professor Beck had never yet told him
what time he made, he felt that he was at last getting in
touch with real work. Often he was one of a little bunch
of half milers and milers, and there was a pleasurable intoxication
in working past this runner or that, and, as sometimes
happened, finishing well in the lead. Professor Beck’s
sole comments at the end of a performance of this sort was
a brief “Well done, Gordon,” or an almost equally laconic
“Try to better that to-morrow.”</p>

<p>But of criticism before and during the practice there
was plenty. “Arms down, Gordon!” “That stride’s too
short; lengthen out! lengthen out!” “You’re running too
fast, Gordon. Ease up on this lap.” “Put your head back
so you can breathe, and, for goodness’ sake, <em>keep your arms
down</em>!”</p>

<p>But the latter injunction seemed to be always wasted.
Try as he would—and he did try—Wayne’s arms could
not be made to hang; they always, sooner or later, got glued
to his breast, making him look—so Don said—as though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
had a pain. Professor Beck reprimanded and scowled and
growled, but to no purpose. Wayne replied that he could
run better with his arms against his body, and he didn’t see
what difference it made. Professor Beck explained all over
again that his lungs ought to have free play and that by
keeping his arms and shoulders back they were unrestricted.</p>

<p>“But I’m more comfortable that way,” Wayne pleaded.
And the professor would smile in exasperation and beg him
to try the other way “if you <em>please</em>, Gordon!” And
Wayne would promise and forthwith try, and in the middle
of a two-third-mile run discover to his amazement that his
clinched hands were as tightly glued to his chest as ever!</p>

<p>But aside from this defection Wayne’s performance
was promising and Don was delighted. “You’ll make the
team sure,” he declared. “And if you do you’re almost
certain of a first or second place. Neither St. Eustace nor
Warrenton has a first-class miler. You and young Whitehead,
and possibly Banks, will make a good trio.”</p>

<p>But if running on the cinder track pleased Wayne the
daily practice at starting equally displeased him. It was
exasperating and tiresome work, but there was a good fifteen
minutes of it every afternoon, and Wayne had a lot
to learn. In squads of four or five the runners and jumpers
were placed at the mark and sent off at the report of a
pistol. The sprinters and hurdlers were instructed in the
crouching, and the long-distance men and the jumpers in the
standing start. Time and again Wayne, with his left foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
on the mark, his body thrown forward, and his ears straining
for the report of the pistol in Professor Beck’s hand,
would for a single instant relax his vigilance, when—<em>bang!</em>
and off would go the rest of the squad a good yard or more
ahead of him! And when they all came trotting back for
another try Professor Beck would inquire politely:</p>

<p>“Asleep, Gordon?”</p>

<p>Perhaps on the next attempt, mindful of his previous
error, Wayne would offend in the opposite direction and
start with a wild plunge down the track only to realize that
the pistol report which he had seemed to hear was only a
thing of imagination born of strained nerves and muscles.
Then he would crawl shamefacedly back to meet the grins
of the other chaps and to hear Professor Beck remark
pleasantly:</p>

<p>“I see you’ve woke up, Gordon.”</p>

<p>But there was one thing that acted as a solace: a good
start was always applauded by the professor; perhaps in
only two words, but worth to the boy whole sentences of
praise or compliment. And, besides, his work was not so
hard as that of the sprinters, who were forced to crouch like
monkeys or cats—Wayne was never able to decide which
they most resembled—for long seconds at a time, only to
have the signal come when they had shifted their weight
for a second from legs to arms, and to either leave them
dazed on their mark or to send them sprawling on the
cinders. That, at least, was spared him. He was not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
only one of the many candidates for track honors that made
a muddle of starting, but, as Don cheerfully told him after
a specially disastrous afternoon, “there was no other fellow
in the lot who could start wrong and do it with such infinite
variety.”</p>

<p>But Don was often sorely tried and perplexed in those
days of early training, and the unnecessary candor of the
remark may be forgiven him. Don had his own training
to go through with, and was besides compelled to take an
active part in the training of others. The hurdlers and
jumpers in especial were under his instruction, while, nominally
at least, he was responsible for the proper work of all
the candidates. Dave alone appeared undisturbed by
events. At least four times a week he practiced with the
hammer, Professor Beck viewing his performances with
scarce concealed displeasure. For Dave’s hammer throwing
did not improve as the season wore on. Of the two other
aspirants for success at the sport, one, Hardy, had already
equaled Dave’s best throw that spring; and the other, Kendall,
gave promise of speedily attaining a like degree of
proficiency. But Dave did not believe in worrying; he
only tried his best, put every scrap of strength into his
efforts, tossed the twelve-pound ball and wire away over
the grass as though it were the veriest plaything, and then
exhibited neither surprise nor disappointment when measurement
revealed the fact that once again he had failed
to equal his own not overgood record made in the interscholastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
meet the year before. Instead of fretting Dave
worked the harder, and if honest endeavor deserves reward
Dave should have captured the championship.</p>

<p>Week after week of good, bright weather, sometimes
brisk with north winds, but never disagreeable, came and
went. Wayne ran one-hundred-yard dashes, trotted slow
miles, sped over moderate three quarters—always with a
jolly sprint for the last forty or fifty yards—went jogging
across country over fences, hedges, and brooks, put in a bad
quarter of an hour in front of the starter’s pistol, occasionally
had a whole day of rest, and every night settled down
to his studies with a cool, clear brain and a splendid absence
of nerves. And one day the entries for the spring handicap
meeting were posted and all the candidates for athletic
honors went at their training harder than ever.</p>

<small>DON LOSES HIS TEMPER</small></h2>


<p>“Connor, you and Middleton will try the full flight together.
Get on your mark, and I’ll start you in a minute.
Perkins, you took the full distance yesterday, didn’t you?
Well, report to Mr. Beck, please, for starting; and you’d
better go a hundred and twenty on the flat at about a sixteen-second
clip. Hello, Wayne, aren’t you working to-day?”</p>

<p>Wayne suited his step to Don’s and trotted up the track
with him to where Connor and Middleton were waiting at
the far end of the long line of hurdles.</p>

<p>“I guess so; after a while. Beck’s busy with the broad
jumpers. Are you going over the hurdles?”</p>

<p>“If I get a chance. Hang it, I haven’t had any time to
practice this week. Connor and Middleton have taken up
every minute, and they’re awful duffers at hurdling. Perkins
is a good man, though; he just passed you a minute
ago. Wait until I get these fellows off and I’ll talk to
you.”</p>

<p>Don went to the starting line and Wayne, drawing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
coat more closely about his running costume, perched himself
on an unused hurdle at the side of the track and looked
on. Don took a small revolver from his pocket and stationed
himself behind the two hurdlers.</p>

<p>“Both you fellows must try and get over the hurdles
lower. Remember that it doesn’t matter if you strike them;
it won’t hurt you. Connor, you start well and make your
first hurdle all right, but after that you get ragged. Keep
your pace up to the end; you ought to finish just as fast
as you begin. Middleton, you haven’t got your pace right
yet. Your first two steps are always too short, and the result
is that your third leaves you too far from the hurdle. You
must correct that. I’ll give you both two tries over the full
flight. This time take it easy and be careful. On your
mark! Set!”</p>

<p><em>Bang!</em> went the little pistol and the two hurdlers dashed
forward toward the first of the three-feet-six-inch obstacles.
Don ran alongside on the cinders, watching their performance
and shouting instructions.</p>

<p>“Higher next time, Connor, by a half inch.”
“Lengthen your stride, Middleton.” “Take your time,
both of you.” “That’s better, Connor; good work. Don’t
stop; keep on to the finish!”</p>

<p>The three hurdlers came slowly back, listening in patient
and respectful attention to Don’s criticisms, and again
dug their spikes into the cinders at the mark, crouching
low and practicing little starts. Don called to Wayne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m going over them once, Wayne, to show these
chaps what I’ve been talking about. Will you start me?”</p>

<p>Wayne hurried up and took the pistol.</p>

<p>“You fellows,” continued Don, turning to the two tyros,
“had better run along and watch me over the hurdles.
You’ll see what I mean by jumping low, and you, Middleton,
had better watch my stride. All ready, Wayne.”</p>

<p>The latter cocked the pistol. “On your mark! Set!”</p>

<p>At the report of the pistol Don straightened himself
quickly from his crouching position and tore lightly down on
the first of the ten hurdles, springing off the right foot, turning
his body slightly to the right and clearing the bar with
a long, low, graceful rise that was scarcely more than a
stride. Three long steps and he was again in the air, his
rear ankle just tipping the wood as he landed on the ball
of his right foot and sped on, apparently without effort.
Again and again his white-clad form rose and fell down
the line of hurdles until the last one was surmounted and he
had crossed the finish running like a deer, swiftly and
lightly. Then with a series of high, shortening strides he
gradually slowed down and turned back.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it pretty, the way he does that?” said a voice in
Wayne’s ear, and the latter turned to find Paddy beside
him.</p>

<p>“You bet it is!” answered Wayne warmly. “I wish I
could do it!”</p>

<p>“Ever try?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“No; did you?”</p>

<p>“Once; last year. Don had five hurdles set up out
here, and I told him I’d beat him over if he’d give me a
start. So I tried. He waited until I was over the first
hurdle. Then he started.” Paddy paused and grinned
reminiscently.</p>

<p>“Who won?”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t any race, me boy. The spalpeen went
across the finish while I was trying to pick myself out of
the third hurdle. You see, I got over the first all right,
but when I reached the second there was something wrong;
I had too many feet or—or something; and I got there on
the wrong one. I finally jumped off one of them—I think
it was the left hind foot—knocked the hurdle over, ran
for the next one, landed on top of it, and then—well, then
the hurdle and I were all mixed up together. I think it
struck me, but I’m not sure. Oh, hurdle racing is something
that I wasn’t cut out for. I’m quite willing that Don
should do my share.”</p>

<p>Don and the other two lads came up while Wayne was
still laughing over Paddy’s narrative, and, yielding the
pistol, Wayne stood aside and watched the next trial. Don
got into his overcoat again and Connor and Middleton
crouched at the mark.</p>

<p>“Now, see what you can do,” said Don. “I’ll tell
you frankly that neither of you can make the team
on such work as you’ve done up to date. So, for goodness’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
sake, put brains into your hurdling. I’ll time you this
try, and the fellow that finishes second will have to work
hard next week if he wants to go to the interscholastic
meeting.”</p>

<p>Once more the pistol sounded, the two boys left the
mark as though shot from a cannon, and together took the
first two bars. Then Middleton began to drop behind, and
at the last hurdle was a long two yards to the rear of Connor,
who finished well and strongly.</p>

<p>“Nineteen and a fifth,” called Don. “Slow work
that. But you both showed improvement. Your stride’s
all wrong yet, though, Middleton; two short at first; nothing
even; you’ll get beaten every time until you mend it.
I won’t try you over the full flight again until you’ve had a
full week’s work learning the stride. Monday you’d better
go back to the low hurdles again and try taking about three
of them. That’s all to-day.”</p>

<p>Middleton and Connor, the former looking very meek,
seized their wraps and trotted away toward the dressing
room. Don joined Wayne and Paddy on the top of the
hurdle and the three swung their legs and chatted until
Professor Beck approached and summoned Wayne to the
starting line of the mile.</p>

<p>It was Saturday afternoon, a week from the date of the
handicap meeting, and the track candidates were out in
full force. Groups of white-clad boys dotted the field. The
broad jumpers and the pole vaulters were busy near by;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
several sprinters were trotting toward the grand stand after
their trials; the hammer and shot candidates were hard at
work; a number of fellows were jogging about the track;
on the gridiron the spring football squad was learning the
rudiments of the game, and the sound of the bat broke
sharply on the air now and then where the baseball candidates
were at practice. On the links a number of figures
moved hither and thither at the will of the speeding white
spheres. The scene was a bright and busy one, and overhead
the blue April sky arched cloudless from hill to
mountain.</p>

<p>“Gordon, get your coat off and limber up,” commanded
Professor Beck. “I want you to run your distance to-day
on time.”</p>

<p>Wayne threw aside his coat, looked to his running shoes,
and trotted down the cinders to the one-hundred-yard post
and back again, stretching his muscles and relishing the
faint gritting sound that his shoes made on the smooth,
level path. Then he got on his mark and listened to the
professor’s directions.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you your time after each quarter,” he announced.
“I want you to study it and your pace so that
you will be able in a race to judge accurately how fast you
are going. Get away quickly and get a good steady pace
by the end of the first sixty yards. Remember you’ve got
a quarter of a mile farther to run than you’re used to. And
remember, too, that on the last half lap you must increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
your speed. Keep that in mind and save enough strength
for a good hard spurt at the finish. Sutton will pace you on
the last quarter. On your mark!”</p>

<p>Wayne sped away from a good start, and, according to
directions, found a steady pace ere the end of the first half
minute, and ran in good form. At the end of the first
quarter Professor Beck announced the time and bade him
to slow up a little. The half mile was accomplished well
under 2.28. When he reached the line at the end of the
third quarter Sutton was waiting and started off beside him
at a pace that made Wayne’s eyes open. But he did not
try to overhaul the fleet-footed four-hundred-and-forty-yard
runner at once, but ran well within himself and saved his
strength for the last half lap. He began to feel the pace
now, and his feet showed a tendency to drag. As he passed
the line on the next to the last lap some twenty yards
behind the middle-distance man Professor Beck was waiting
watch in hand.</p>

<p>“All right,” he called. “Don’t hurry until you turn
for the finish.”</p>

<p>Around the track for the last time the two runners
went. Sutton increased his pace and his lead about halfway
down the back stretch. Overcoming the impulse to
try and run him down then, Wayne kept up his steady,
moderate pace until the turn toward the finish. Then he
called on his reserve strength and spurted forward, making
a fine race to the tape and finishing well up behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
speedy Sutton. As he trotted back to the line Professor
Beck met him.</p>

<p>“Your time was five minutes and twenty seconds, Gordon.
Try and remember your speed, so that next time you
will be able to regulate your pace by to-day’s performance.
You kept your arms up as usual and your second quarter
was a bit too fast. Next time try and run it about five
seconds slower, and put that five seconds into the finish. I
expect you to cut that time down by at least fifteen seconds
before the meet. That’s all this afternoon. Work yourself
easy the first of next week; I think I’d leave out the
cross-country run Monday and do about two miles slow on
the track. I’ll give you another trial on Thursday.”</p>

<p>Wayne trotted away to the gymnasium, had a refreshing
shower and rub down, and had done a full hour’s work
at his studies when Don came in at dusk. The latter was
not satisfied with his chum’s performance.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to beat that, Wayne. Sturgis, of St. Eustace,
ran the mile last year easily in 5.02⅕,” he said. “And
Warrenton has men that can do nearly as well. But it’s
early yet. I do wish you’d get out of the habit of hugging
yourself. I watched you this afternoon. You had your
hands over your lungs during the whole last half of the
mile.”</p>

<p>“Hang it,” Wayne responded, “you and Beck are
awful cranks! I tell you that I can run better that way.
I’ve tried letting my arms swing, and it won’t work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“No one wants you to swing your arms,” answered Don.
“Just let them alone and they’ll look after themselves.
Only, for goodness’ sake stop putting them on your chest
and loading your lungs down!”</p>

<p>“I don’t load my lungs down,” answered Wayne a trifle
shortly. “My lungs are all right. I had plenty of breath
when I finished to-day to run another mile.”</p>

<p>“All right; but you wait and see, my boy. Folks that
have been at the business longer than you know more about
it, I guess; and you’ll discover some fine day that you’ve just
thrown away your chances of doing something by sticking
to a habit that you could easily break yourself of now if
you’d try.”</p>

<p>“I have tried; I can’t run any other way.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t tried hard enough. It’s nonsense to say
that you <em>can’t</em> keep your arms off your chest; you just
<em>won’t</em>!”</p>

<p>Wayne retired behind his Cæsar in silent dignity, and
Don, his temper worn by the day’s labor with the hurdlers
and jumpers, isolated himself in his window seat and scowled
over his history of Greece until hunger drove both to supper,
by which time the small quarrel was forgotten and the
two raced downstairs and across to Turner Hall in the best
of spirits.</p>

<small>THE HOME RUN</small></h2>


<p>Events were crowded thickly into the next week.
Gardiner returned to the Academy on Monday and shook
up football affairs in a way that surprised even Paddy.
On Tuesday two more graduates put in an appearance on
the campus and with most terrifying scowls proceeded to
work miracles, one with the sprinters and the other with
the baseball candidates. The latter coach reached the
scene none too soon, for the next day Shrewsburg sent down
an aggregation of hard-hitting young gentlemen who had
already earned a reputation that reached up and down the
valley. Most of the fellows turned out for the game and
cheered lustily for the crimson-stockinged youngsters, but
despite the support of the grand stand Hillton put up a
ragged kind of ball, and at the end of the sixth inning the
wearers of the green S were five runs to the good and their
earning capacity seemed still unlimited.</p>

<p>Wayne and Don and Dave saw most of the contest from
where the former was putting Perkins over the high hurdles
in a fraction over record time. Later they adjourned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
stand and Don took a hand in the cheering with encouraging
results. Hillton went to bat in the first of the seventh
amid a loud chorus of cheers only to retire in one-two-three
order. Then the coach asserted authority and a new pitcher
went into the box, a lower-middle-class boy, Forest by
name, who had gained some success with his class nine the
preceding spring. He had a fresh, smiling, and ingenuous
countenance, and he delivered nice straight balls that went
so fast that the first two Shrewsburg batters went out on
strikes and the third one reached first base through the
medium of a short grounder that seemed to belong to nobody
in particular, and for which nobody tried. But the side was
out in the next moment, for the fourth batsman struck up a
nice clean fly that settled cosily into the right-fielder’s
hands, and the crimson stockings trotted in under a salvo
of applause.</p>

<p>“Say, where’s Paddy?” asked Wayne, while the first
man at bat was recovering his equilibrium after striking
unsuccessfully at a deceptive drop. Dave grinned.</p>

<p>“Paddy’s busy. Gardiner’s got every candidate, new
and old, back of the gym teaching them to pass. And
Gardiner’s so full of new ideas that Paddy’s head is in a
whir all the time. I fear he’ll have brain fever soon.”</p>

<p>“There’ll be two of us,” said Don feelingly, “unless
Middleton goes out of training. He knocked over every
hurdle to-day except the last three. I don’t understand
how he came to miss those.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“Side’s out,” interrupted Wayne. “This is the last
of the eighth, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s get the fellows to cheering.” Don got up
and encouraged the stand to renewed efforts, and the
Shrewsburg captain went to bat.</p>

<p>“Twelve to seven,” muttered Dave. “I guess we don’t
want this game.”</p>

<p>“Nine’s awful rocky this year,” said Don. “But I’ll
bet Kirk will teach ’em something before the first St. Eustace
game.”</p>

<p>“Good work, Gray!” yelled Wayne, as the Hillton first
baseman captured a liner hot off the end of the Shrewsburg
captain’s stick.</p>

<p>“Is that Carl Gray?” asked Dave.</p>

<p>“Yes; I guess he’ll get on to the team. He’s made two
of the seven runs so far.”</p>

<p>Once more the Shrewsburg batters failed to make a
safe hit, and Forest got a good hearty cheer all to himself
as he threw down the ball and went to the bench. It was
the first of the ninth now and the home team’s last chance
to tie the score or win, either a difficult task. But the
cheering became continuous, and the first man at bat, obeying
instructions, waited patiently for his base and got it on
four balls. Then a batting streak came to the Hillton players,
and the next fellow at the plate struck the first ball delivered
safely just inside of the third baseman. The next
batter also found the ball and knocked it hotly to shortstop,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
who fumbled it; and the bases were full. But the Shrewsburg
pitcher settled down to work and the following Hillton
man went out on strikes. And then happened a most unfortunate
incident for Shrewsburg. The coachers were busy
back of first and third bases, and the Shrewsburg pitcher
allowed the noise to worry him a little, just enough to turn an
inshoot into a catastrophe. The ball struck the batsman on
the hip, and he limped to first, the men on bases moved up,
and Hillton scored her eighth run, amid quickly suppressed
applause from the seats. The pitcher lost his nerve then
and delivered a straight ball, shoulder high, which lit on
the center of the bat and went sailing just over his head,
bringing another runner in and reaching first too late to
put the batsman out. The bases were still full, with but
one out, and the grand stand was wild with excitement.
The next fellow at the plate, perhaps determining to profit
by the pitcher’s collapse, allowed the first two balls to go
by unnoticed. Both were strikes. He looked worried for
an instant as he tapped the plate with his stick and again
faced the pitcher. The third delivery was a ball, and the
batsman smiled.</p>

<p>“Hit it, Jim!” shrieked a friend in the audience, but
Jim merely broadened his smile into a grin, and the umpire
called “Two balls!” Again he remained motionless.
“Three balls!” Fellows on the seats began to breathe hard
and lean restively forward. The Shrewsburg pitcher
glanced around the bases, wiped the stained leather sphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
pensively on his gray trousers, shot his hands upward, and
sent a straight ball waist-high over the plate. The batsman
tossed aside his stick and took a step toward first base.</p>

<p>“Striker’s out!” called the umpire.</p>

<p>A howl of derision went up from the watchers as the
youth turned back and walked toward the seat with a
pained expression on his face. “Idiot!” commented Dave.</p>

<p>But there was yet a chance. A three-bagger would tie
the score. A slightly built boy selected a bat and took his
place at the plate. Simultaneously the pitcher turned,
waved his hand, and the fielders scattered farther away.
Some one started a cheer.</p>

<p>“’Rah-rah-rah, ’Rah-rah-rah, ’Rah-rah-rah, Gray!”</p>

<p>“There’s your friend, Wayne,” said Dave. “Hope
he’ll swipe out a home run.”</p>

<p>“So do I. But no such luck, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>The pitcher was evidently afraid of Gray’s prowess
with the bat and went to work skillfully to deceive him by
all his arts. But Gray was cool and used the best of judgment.
The first ball sped slowly by and resolved itself into
a wide outcurve. “One ball!” droned the umpire. The
catcher protested loudly, indignantly. Then he marched
forward and held a whispered conversation with the pitcher,
while the audience laughed derisively.</p>

<p>“No secrets!” bawled a small junior.</p>

<p>The catcher returned, and, leaning far to the right,
smote his glove disconcertingly. But Gray refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
glance around or lose his head. The pitcher’s wonted skill
and coolness had returned to him. The men on bases were
playing far off, ready to take advantage of anything in the
shape of a hit. Up went the pitcher’s hands, forward shot
his arm, and Gray leaped desperately backward.</p>

<p>“Strike!” called the umpire.</p>

<p>Gray looked disconcerted for an instant. Then he
tapped the plate resolutely and again faced the pitcher.
The next ball was far out and the boy at bat made no offer
at it.</p>

<p>“Two balls!”</p>

<p>Again the chap with the great green S decorating his
jersey went through his contortions, and the sphere sped
forward. Gray struck at it with all his force and spun
around on his heel. The catcher dropped to his knee and
picked the ball from the dust. It was a most deceptive drop
and the waiting batsmen on the bench nodded their heads
in approval.</p>

<p>“Two strikes!”</p>

<p>A little spot of deeper red shone on Gray’s cheek now
and he moved his stick a bit nervously behind his shoulder.
The pitcher stepped back into his box, nodded to a sign
from the catcher, and let drive. Then there was a sharp
report as Gray’s bat struck the speeding sphere, the grand
stand was on its feet, the three men on bases raced home
almost in a bunch, and Gray was rounding first base at a
desperate pace!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>High and far sped the ball. The left-fielder was racing
back down the field. Would he catch it? Pandemonium
reigned in the grand stand. Wayne and the others were
on their feet, shouting wildly and waving their caps. Gray
reached second base, cast a glance toward left field, and
came on. The fielder turned almost under the ball and
reached upward, leaped back a step, clutched wildly, and
fell. The ball, tipping his fingers just beyond his reach,
dropped to earth. And Gray, panting and happy, crossed
the home plate into the arms of his exultant friends.</p>

<p>The score was now in Hillton’s favor by one run: thirteen
to twelve. The half was soon over. The next man
struck a short grounder and was out at first. And Shrewsburg
went to bat, desperate resolve written large on every
face.</p>

<p>“Say, that friend Gray of yours is a great little boy!”
exclaimed Dave, as he pulled his cap on again and pounded
his feet in time to the refrain of Hilltonians, which the
audience had started to chant.</p>

<p>“That’s the finest home run that’s ever been seen on
this field since I’ve been in school,” said Don. “And it
was needed, too. A home run in time saves the nine.”</p>

<p>“I hope it’ll save this nine,” laughed Wayne. “But
those chaps look as though they meant business. One run
will tie us; two will beat us.”</p>

<p>But fortune proved a friend to Hillton, and Gray’s wonderful
hit saved the day, for Forest worked like a veteran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
pitcher and struck out the first two Shrewsburg men in
short order. The next batter wrote finis to the game by
sending a high foul into the first baseman’s gloves, and the
grand stand was emptied of its throng. Shrewsburg accepted
defeat manfully, answered the Hillton cheer with
one equally hearty, bundled itself into the waiting coach,
and took its departure with much good-natured defiant
flaunting of green banners. Gray, by one brilliant stroke,
had achieved a much-coveted position on the nine and was
a school hero for many weeks.</p>

<p>The following day Wayne again sped over the mile
while Professor Beck held the watch on him. But something
was wrong. The professor gave him the result with
ill-concealed displeasure.</p>

<p>“Five minutes twenty-three seconds. That’ll never do.
You must cut off fifteen seconds, Gordon, if you expect to
make the team. What’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>But Wayne couldn’t tell. He had done his best, he
thought, and asserted positively that he could run the distance
again without feeling it, which feat was naturally not
allowed.</p>

<p>“Take a rest to-morrow,” counseled the professor, “so
that you’ll be in good condition for Saturday. For I’ll tell
you frankly that if you don’t mend that time in the handicaps
you’ll find yourself out of it.”</p>

<p>And Wayne jogged back to the gymnasium feeling very
forlorn and discouraged. But after his bath and rubbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
his spirits returned and he vowed to open the professor’s
eyes next time. He had entered for both the half and the
mile, the former on Professor Beck’s advice. “For,” said
the latter, “the races are far apart, and you’ll get over the
effects of the half before the mile is called. And the half
may limber you up for the longer distance.”</p>

<p>Wayne spent the next day in rest. Don, too, was idle,
as were most of the boys who were to participate in the
handicaps, and he and Wayne took a short walk along the
river in the afternoon and returned at dusk in time for an
hour’s study before supper. The handicaps were announced
that evening, and, as is usual in like cases, there was some
dissatisfaction expressed by contestants. Wayne found that
he was to be allowed twenty yards in the half mile and was
to run from scratch in the mile, and was quite satisfied.
One thing that told its own story was the announcement
that Merton would receive an allowance of eight feet in the
hammer throw.</p>

<p>“Poor old Dave!” said Don. “That’ll cut him up like
anything. I suppose it means that Hardy has turned out
to be a better man, for you see he’s down for scratch.
Hello! they’ve given Middleton four seconds in the one-hundred-and-twenty-yard
hurdles; well, he ought to come somewhere
near winning with that allowance.”</p>

<p>Wayne went to bed that night filled with determination
to win on the morrow. He was not the sort of lad that
allows the thought of coming events to keep him awake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and he was soon fast asleep; nerves were practically unknown
to Wayne. But his brain proved more troublesome
and continued its labors after the body had gone to rest,
with the result that his slumbers were disturbed by dreams
in which he seemed to be trying to win the mile race with
Professor Beck perched like an old man of the sea on his
shoulders, and Don continually thrusting hurdles in his
path.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>BADLY BEATEN</small></h2>


<p>Saturday dawned fresh and clear. A little breeze,
redolent of forest depths and growing things, blew over
the meadows from Mount Adam. The river sparkled beneath
its touch and the broad carpet of yellowish green
marshland beyond felt its breath and stirred in response.
The school turned out to a man—or should I say to a boy?—and
long before the hour set for the meeting the stand
and much of the turf without the ropes that guarded the
track in the vicinity of the finish lines were well thronged.
The village came too, in the persons of the postmaster and
the livery-stable keeper and the two rival grocers and many
others of local prominence; and their wives and daughters
came with them and lent an added dash of color to the
scene.</p>

<p>The meeting was much like every other event of the
kind. Contestants ran, hurdled, or jumped; the judges
looked inscrutable; and the audience cheered indiscriminately.
It was little to them whether this boy was disappointed
or that one made glad; they applauded a brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
finish or an extra inch surmounted with the pole,
and cared but little what the figures might be. There
were no records broken that day, but Professor Beck and
Don and the coaches—of which there was a small army
on hand, many having arrived on the morning train—were
on the whole well satisfied with the results shown. Don
took both hurdle events, and Perkins came in a close second.
Middleton failed to use his allowance to good effect, and
made a poor third in each race. Dave threw the hammer
one hundred and thirty-eight feet four inches, which, with
his handicap of eight feet, gave him second place in the
event. Hardy threw one hundred and forty-seven feet two
inches, and Kendall was third with one hundred and forty
feet nine inches. Hardy’s performance assured him a place
on the team and indicated a possibility of victory at the
forthcoming meeting. The pole vault, the sprints, the
jumps, and the quarter mile were all well contested, and
some of them showed even brilliant work. Whitehead ran
away from the field in the last twenty yards of the half
mile, and Wayne finished a poor sixth, partly owing to the
fact that he had made a bad start and partly because the
pace was too hot for him; Whitehead’s time was 2.07⅕.</p>

<p>After such a sorry showing as that it seemed that Fortune
owed Wayne some reparation in the mile event; if
so, Fortune didn’t pay the debt. Profiting by the experience
gained in the half mile, Wayne got off well with the
pistol and took a place in the van of the group of eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
runners. At the quarter mile he was third and felt as
fresh as a colt; at the half he had pulled himself up to a
place on the inside of the track and but a yard behind the
leader. At the three quarters he was still running strong,
but Whitehead had passed him and was disputing the lead
with Battles. At the beginning of the last lap, Wayne
found himself fourth. On the back stretch he passed Seers
and drew up behind Whitehead and Battles. His legs were
strong, his breath good, and he could have run another mile
without minding it. But after the turn, when he dashed
ahead to win, he found to his dismay that there was no
dash in him. Battles and Whitehead tore away from him
and Seers crawled up, hung for an instant on his flank, and
passed him. Battles won first by a fraction of a second,
Whitehead was next, Seers third, and Wayne fourth. The
winner’s time was 5.03⅘; Wayne’s, 5.19.</p>

<p>He crawled dejectedly to the dressing room and refused
to be comforted by Whitehead’s predictions of better success
next time. He was out of it, and he knew it. There
was nothing to do save put as good a face as possible upon
defeat. He trotted away to the gymnasium before the
meeting was quite over and took his bath and rub down
almost alone. To-day these things failed to summon back
his spirits, and he went to his room, perched himself on his
own particular window seat, gazed out across the sunlit
river and marshes, and thought it all over.</p>

<p>It seemed hard luck. A few months before he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
have cared but little whether he made the track team or
not. But now it was different. The virus of athletic ambition
was in his veins, and the afternoon’s defeat, entailing
as it did loss of position on the track team, seemed magnified
into an overwhelming catastrophe. He tried to summon
back the old indifference; he remembered scoffing at
Don because the latter made so much of athletic triumphs;
somehow it was different to-day, and he wished that he had
resisted Don’s appeals and stayed out of it all. Then a
sense of injury overwhelmed him. What right had Don
and Professor Beck to encourage him as they had into
thinking that the long hard training would win him a place
on the team and then to drop him like a—like a hot penny
because he had failed once or twice to come up to their
standard? He was so certain all the time that he could
have won if—if—what? What had been the trouble? He
knit his brows and stared hard across the river. He had
had no trouble as to wind; his legs had remained strong
and tireless to the end; he had simply been unable to run
as fast at the finish as the others. Very well, then, it only
remained to learn how to save his strength so that he could
spurt hard in the last fifty yards. Why couldn’t they give
him another chance? In the midst of his musings Don
came in. He tossed a pair of grips on to the table and
joined Wayne at the window. There was an atmosphere
of constraint in the study, and for a moment neither boy
spoke. Then Don broke the silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry, Wayne.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose it doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>There was another interval of silence. Then Don broke
out with:</p>

<p>“But it does matter! I feel all broke up over it! It’s
too bad, old chap; that’s what it is. But perhaps it isn’t
all up yet. I’m going to try and get Beck to give you
another try, Wayne. Don’t you think you can do better?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I <em>know</em> I can. I could have won easily to-day
if—if— The trouble was I didn’t have any speed left at
the finish; even Seers passed me! Can’t I learn to save up
for a spurt? I wasn’t tired; I could have run another
mile, I’m sure, Don.”</p>

<p>“Of course you can learn, if—if there is only time.
You see, old chap, there is only three weeks left. But I am
going to see Beck, and I’ll do all I can. I feel certain that
you can beat that time to-day, and better it, too. There
has been a mistake somewhere; you haven’t been worked
right. And it’s Beck’s fault, I guess; at any rate, it isn’t
yours.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s nobody’s fault, I reckon; it’s just rotten
luck!”</p>

<p>“No, luck doesn’t enter into it, Wayne. There’s been a
mistake somewhere; and I hope Beck will see it.” He
paused and looked in a troubled way at his chum. “Perhaps
you think it is my fault, Wayne?” he said wistfully.
Wayne shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“No. I was rather blaming you and Beck a while ago,
but I had no right to. It isn’t your fault at all, Don, and
don’t you worry about me; you’ve got enough to attend
to. I’ll be all right. Only if you don’t mind speaking to
Beck about it, you know——”</p>

<p>“Of course I will. Right away, too. All the fellows
are asked to report in Society House this evening at eight.
Beck is going to announce the names of the fellows who are
to go to training table Monday, and some of the grads are
going to talk a bit. Remsen came to-day.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Remsen; the football man?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he used to coach the eleven. He’s a jolly nice
fellow, and awfully popular here. He’ll probably talk some,
too. I hope he does; he’s worth hearing. You’ll go, won’t
you?”</p>

<p>“If I’m wanted; though, if I’m not going to be on the
team, I don’t see what use——”</p>

<p>“Of course you’re going on! So shut up and keep
chipper. I promised Beck to go to his room at five, and it’s
nearly that time. Don’t get blue, old chap; we’ll fix it all
right!”</p>

<p>When the door had slammed to after Don the boy at
the window sat a long while looking out on to the darkening
landscape. The river grew to a deep violet with steel-gray
ripples. The marsh became filled with shadows, and
the sun dropped behind the purple hills and left the twilight
cold and colorless. With a sigh and a shake of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
broad shoulders Wayne jumped up, pulled down the shades,
and lighted the gas. He seized the first book that came to
hand, a Greek Testament, and settled himself resolutely in
the armchair.</p>

<p>“If Beck won’t give me another show,” he muttered as
he found his place, “I’ll go ahead and train on my own
hook. And I’ll cut that old mile down to five minutes
even if I have to work all day. And then they’ll <em>have</em> to
take me on!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>REMSEN’S PLEDGE</small></h2>


<p>The tiny hall in Society House was crowded when
Wayne and Don entered at a little before eight. All the
candidates for the track team, the crew, the football team,
and the baseball nine were there, and a group of five graduates
were talking together by the stage. At the latter
Wayne looked with some curiosity. Gardiner topped them
all by half a head. Kirk, the old baseball player, looked
like a pygmy beside him. Don pointed out the others: Barret,
the renowned hurdler; Burns, once a famous sprinter;
and Kenyon, holder of the intercollegiate two-hundred-and-twenty-yard
record. Paddy joined them and the three
found seats near the front. Then Dave entered and
squeezed into a three-inch space between Wayne and
Paddy.</p>

<p>“How’d they go, Dave?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“Rotten; I can’t throw a hammer. I used to think I
could, but——” He shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“Go on wid yer,” said Paddy. “Yez kin bate thim
all if yez ’ud only think so.—But what in the name of goodness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
was the matter with you to-day?” he asked, turning
to Wayne. Wayne smiled cheerfully and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Blest if I know, Paddy. I guess I’m like Dave; I
used to think I could run, but——” He shook his head in
mimicry of Dave and wiped an imaginary tear from his eye.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re all a sorry lot,” said Paddy in disgust.
“All except Don, and he can’t help winning, hang him!”
Further compliments were interrupted by the appearance
of Professor Beck and the former football coach, Stephen
Remsen. Paddy jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>“Now then, fellows,” he cried, facing the hall, “three
times three for Remsen!” The cheers were given with a
will and the recipient bowed his thanks smilingly. Then
Professor Beck took the platform, and, after a few words
of criticism on the day’s events, read the training table list.
Sixteen fellows were selected to go to “Mother” Burke’s
in the village, and twelve were named for a table in the
school dining room. Wayne’s name was on neither list and
he shot an inquiring glance at Don. The latter whispered:</p>

<p>“It’s all right. You’ll go to table later.”</p>

<p>Two of the graduates, fine, healthy-looking men, took
their turns after the professor and pointed out some defects
in the afternoon’s performances, spoke encouragingly to the
fellows, and were cheered as they took their seats. Then
Remsen arose and the little audience became on the instant
as quiet as though made up of so many wax figures. Remsen
was more than a Hillton graduate, more than a successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
coach; he was a sort of school deity whom successive
classes had long worshiped. In his school days he had been
stroke in a winning crew, had excelled with the weights,
and had been captain of the football eleven when it had
devastated the surrounding country of laurels. These
things are enough to place a man’s name high on the roster
of fame and to earn him gratitude. But besides this Remsen
had been football coach for three years, during which
time the team had won two victories from and played a tie
with St. Eustace; and always, ever since his graduation,
he had labored unceasingly for the school and had done
more than any other individual toward establishing its
athletics on a firm, stable, and honest basis.</p>

<p>In appearance he was about thirty years of age, and
“football man” was stamped all over his well-built frame.
He was the kind of man for whom one would have predicted
success in whatever undertaking he had entered.
His face was handsome and manly; his eyes gray and clear;
and his smile worth seeing. Hillton was proud of him, from
its principal to its smallest junior, and he was proud of Hillton.
When the fellows had stopped clapping he began to
speak.</p>

<p>“I’ve been asked by your principal to say a few words
to you this evening. I make this statement before I begin,
so that if I bore you, you will know where to lay the blame.
Mr. Kenyon and Mr. Barret have told you some things that
it will be worth your while to remember and to profit by;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
because they know just what they are talking about. But
if I undertook to criticise what I saw this afternoon—aside
from the work of the fellows who scattered the hammers
and shots around—I should be out of my depth; I wouldn’t
know a hurdle from a stop-watch if I met them together.
What little I know about weights I am willing to talk
about. But I’ll do that to-morrow, when I hope to meet
the weight men on the campus. And as to football, why,
if there is anything that Mr. Gardiner has forgotten to say
I’ll be glad to say it before I leave.</p>

<p>“To-night I should like to say a few words about training
and athletics in general. I am glad to see so much
interest displayed in the approaching interscholastic meeting.
I hope we’ll win it. We’ve lost it with good grace
for two years past; I think we could win it with even better
grace. But if we don’t come out on top this spring, why,
I’m sure that we can give the other schools some points in
the art of losing. It’s a great thing to be able to lose well;
much greater than being able to win well. I think we do
both well here at Hillton, but there may be room for improvement;
there usually is everywhere. It’s fine to win.
I’d rather win any day than to lose. But I don’t always
manage it. And it’s got to be the same way with a track
team or a football eleven or a crew. Sometimes it has got
to come in second; perhaps third. If no crew was willing
to accept second place there wouldn’t be any races, and
soon there wouldn’t be any crews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have a youngster at home; he isn’t very big yet—just
put on his first pair of trousers the other day—but he
looks a good deal like a football man already. Some day
I expect he’ll come here to school. If he does I hope he
will row on the crew and play on the eleven or the nine,
and, if he can, run well or leap the hurdles. But if I had
my way I’d fix his victories and defeats for him in about a
proportion of one victory to nine defeats. For it isn’t winning
that helps a fellow get a good hard grip on the world,
but losing. Yes, fellows, a boy or a man will learn more
wisdom—good, useful, every-day wisdom—in one defeat
than he will in nine victories. It would be a hard course
for Remsen, Jr., but it would make a better man out of
him in the end than would a whole eight years of first
prizes. So don’t despise defeat, as long as it is honorable.
Learn to make the most of it. Don’t feel down-hearted for
more than two minutes and a half; that’s quite long enough
for regrets. Cheer the victors, and go back and try again.
Don’t blame the other man because he won—it was probably
your own fault; but shake hands with him and, if you
must, tell him to look out for his laurels next time. Defeat
ought to teach us courage, perseverance, manliness, good
temper, and self-possession—all good things to learn. As
I look back on my school and college days I can remember
occasions when I won bigger victories through defeat than
when I rowed in a winning crew or played on a winning
team.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“But that’s enough about losing. You’ll think that I’m
a bird of ill omen, I’m afraid. So let’s talk about something
else. I wonder how many of you fellows realize the fact
that all the hard work and training you have gone through
with and are still undergoing is not, after all, a preparation
toward winning a track meeting or a boat race? Did you
ever stop to ask yourselves what the right aim of athletics
is—what the chief aim should be? Some of you will answer:
‘That’s easy; the chief aim of athletics is winning.’ Wrong;
the true aim of all athletics, the world around, is physical
culture. Winning is of small importance; contests are only
incentives. We go in for athletics because we wish to
attain to a condition of physical fitness that will allow us
to make the most of our lives. Athletics without training
is useless; it will accomplish almost nothing good. I use the
word training here in its fullest meaning: moderation in
diet and exercise, temperance and regularity in daily life,
cleanliness and self-restraint. We train in order that the
actual athletics will benefit us. I might go through the
most approved course of chest-weight and dumb-bell exercise,
but if, as soon as it was over, I went to the table and
stuffed my stomach full of indigestible food, drank a lot
of liquor, smoked a lot of cigarettes or cigars, stayed up
every night until one or two o’clock, took no outdoor exercise
and breathed impure air all day, why, I might as well
let the chest weights alone so far as any benefit is concerned.
Athletics require training, whether we are going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
to compete in sports or not; and training means power to
perform hard tasks with a modicum of fatigue and often
with enjoyment; it enables the body to endure hardships,
heat, cold, or fasting, without becoming endangered, and
it clears the cobwebs out of the brain.</p>

<p>“Unusual strains without previous preparation will
often prove injurious. Training prepares us for those
strains; our ability to meet them increases as the training
advances. The best training is that which trains all parts
of the body in unison. Don’t allow your exercise to develop
one physical portion of your body at the cost of any other;
because you are going to throw weights don’t neglect your
leg muscles; because you are going to try for the one-hundred-yard
dash don’t neglect your arms. In short, avoid
becoming a ‘specialist’ as much as possible. Keep in mind
the fact that general health and not success at one feat is
the end of athletic training.</p>

<p>“I’m doing a good deal more talking than I intended to,
and I dare say I’m boring you badly, just as I feared I
should. But there is one more thing that I want to touch
on while I’ve got you where you can’t get away, and
that——”</p>

<p>“Go on! We like it!” shouted a boy at the back of the
room; and the audience clapped and laughed its approval.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s very good of you,” Remsen continued
smilingly. “But I’m about through. If I was—well, a
kind of athletic dictator in this country, I should require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
from every fellow a verbal signature to this pledge: ‘I will
always play fair!’ It isn’t a very long pledge, but it means
a good deal, as you will see if you’ll consider it. If every
schoolboy, whether an athlete or a grind, and every college
man would sign it and stick to it, we’d never hear of one
school’s having ‘severed athletic relations’ with another;
there’d be no brawling in football games, and we’d never
see the charge of professionalism brought against a college.
And it is a pledge that we need not leave behind us when
we graduate; it’s a good pledge to stick to right through
life.</p>

<p>“I have no fault to find with Hillton athletes on the
score of unfairness. I earnestly believe that athletics are
pure here; but I’m not going to assume any ‘holier than
thou’ attitude; and I hope you won’t. Let us keep them as
pure as we can and give an unobtrusive lesson to other schools—yes,
and colleges. That’s all I’ve got to say, fellows. I
thank you for listening so kindly.”</p>

<p>Ere the cheer had started Don was on his feet.</p>

<p>“Mr. Remsen,” he cried, “won’t you put that pledge
to us? I’m sure every fellow here will sign it gladly.”</p>

<p>A chorus of assent arose and much clapping. Remsen
turned back to the audience and held up his hand.</p>

<p>“You’ve heard what Cunningham has said. Nothing
would please me more than to have you all accept that
pledge. Shall I put it to you?”</p>

<p>One deep, hearty “Yes” swept through the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well. Suppose you take the pledge by rising.
If there are any here who for any reason prefer not to
pledge themselves I hope they will keep their seats without
any embarrassment. There may be some here to-night who
are so certain of their ability to always act rightly that
they will not deem a pledge necessary. I shall think no
less of those who decline to go through the form.”</p>

<p>The speaker paused and looked about the hall, a smiling
brightness in his gray eyes.</p>

<p>“Then after me, fellows, and rise. ‘I will always play
fair.’”</p>

<p>“I will always play fair.” The response was earnest
and hearty, and before the last word had died away every
person in the hall was on his feet—graduates, Professor
Beck, and all; not a person remained seated.</p>

<p>Stephen Remsen looked for a moment into the dozens
of earnest faces before him. Then: “God send we can keep
that pledge!” he said soberly.</p>

<p>Whereupon “Pigeon” Wallace leaped on to a chair and
the cheering began.</p>

<small>DAVE IS MADE HAPPY</small></h2>


<p>On Monday Wayne went to the track at three o’clock
and found Professor Beck instructing the broad jumpers
who were tearing up the newly turned loam with great
gusto. A freckled-faced boy came hurtling through the air
and plumped ankle-deep in the brown soil, and the professor
held the end of the tape to the heel mark.</p>

<p>“Twenty-one feet seven and a half, Gaffney,” he announced.
“That will do for to-day. Take your run on the
track, and don’t let yourself get stiff.” He moved the rake
which he held over the loam, obliterating the marks, and
turned to Wayne.</p>

<p>“Well, my boy, Cunningham tells me that you’re not
satisfied with Saturday’s results. You think you can do
considerably better if you keep on, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I’m sure of it.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I’ll tell you what we’ve decided to do.
We’ll go ahead as before, except that we’ll give more attention
to short distances, and a week from Wednesday I’ll
give you a trial over the mile. If you can do it in 5.15<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
we’ll send you to training table, and if you continue to improve
you’ll go with the team. But first you’ve got to go
around the track six times with your arms swinging; after
you have got so that you can do that and do it with a decent
amount of speed we’ll go on. Does that satisfy you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. May I run now?”</p>

<p>“As soon as you like.”</p>

<p>Wayne threw aside his wraps and limbered up. In a
few moments he trotted back.</p>

<p>“All ready, sir.”</p>

<p>“Never mind the pistol; start yourself. I’ll keep an
eye on you.” Wayne looked down threateningly at each
hand, got on the mark and sprang away.</p>

<p>“Take it easy, Gordon,” called the professor, “and remember
those arms!”</p>

<p>The arms behaved nicely until Wayne fell to wondering
how fast he was going; then they strode up to his breast
and remained unnoticed for a hundred yards. After that
the boy kept one eye on the track and one on his arms and
finally finished the three quarters.</p>

<p>“Hard work, was it?” asked Professor Beck with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, kind of. But it won’t be so hard next time.”</p>

<p>“All right. Get your coat on and keep moving for a
while. Then try the starts with the others.”</p>

<p>The next afternoon Wayne did a half mile in good time
with his hands and arms where they belonged, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
that for the rest of the week the training went on as theretofore,
save that he was put over numerous short distances
to develop his speed and substituted three-mile walks for
the usual runs across country. He made progress almost at
once; on Wednesday he covered the four hundred and forty
yards in 0.56⅗, and began to consider himself something
of a sprinter, even though the first man in the race reached
the tape in 0.52⅕. He was on the track every day that
week except Thursday and Saturday; on Thursday he was
ordered off by Professor Beck and told to rest, and on Saturday
he went over the road for a stiff walk with several
other long-distance men.</p>

<p>It was while he was crossing the green to the gymnasium
after that walk that Dave lumbered across the
turf toward him, swinging his sweater excitedly around
his head.</p>

<p>“One hundred and forty-six!” he yelled exultantly.</p>

<p>“Who? What?” asked Wayne.</p>

<p>“Me! The hammer!” answered Dave, smiting the
other joyfully on the back with a force that nearly upset
him. “I threw it!”</p>

<p>“Really? I’m awfully glad. How’d it happen?”</p>

<p>“Why, you see—well, I don’t quite know. But Remsen’s
been coaching us every day since Monday, as you
know. He’s told me all along that there was something
wrong with my swing, but he couldn’t tell what. But to-day
he grabbed the hammer away from me, told me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
watch it, and sent it spinning. Well, I noticed that he did
one thing that I didn’t: when he let go he gave a peculiar
jerk to his body. Of course, I’ve known about it—they call
it ‘putting the devil into the swing’—but somehow I never
could manage it right. But to-day I saw how it was done—it’s
in the way you manage your feet—and I yelled: ‘I see,
I see! Let me have it!’ At first I couldn’t do it at all.
When I tried to bring my right foot round after the third
swing I forgot to let go at the right moment. But the next
time I did it, and threw a hundred and forty-two. Then
Remsen swung again and I watched. And the next time
I piled two feet six inches on to it; and the next throw
was a hundred and forty-six and a fraction. I’d be throwing
yet if Remsen hadn’t taken the hammer away and sent
me home.” Dave laughed happily. “You wait until to-morrow,
Wayne. Why, now that I’ve learned that little
trick I bet I can beat Hardy by two feet!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m awfully glad,” said Wayne, “and I hope
you will. Does Don know?”</p>

<p>“No; he and Beck went off together just before.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go up to the room; perhaps he’s there.”</p>

<p>They had finished their dressing by this time, and they
piled upstairs and across the green to Bradley. Don was
sitting at the table with a litter of papers before him, all
the gas burning, and the afternoon twilight streaming in
through the windows.</p>

<p>“Well, what——” began Wayne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“Figuring our chances, my boy,” answered Don,
rumpling his hair with nervous fingers.</p>

<p>“How are they?” asked Dave eagerly.</p>

<p>“Slim, mighty slim. I can’t see anything but defeat
and a second place on the ticket.”</p>

<p>“Let me see.” Dave took up a sheet of foolscap and
cast his eyes over it.</p>

<p>“Read it out,” said Wayne.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s see; here we are: Hillton, 4 firsts, 5 seconds,
1 third, total 36 points; St. Eustace, 6 firsts, 5 seconds,
1 third, total 46 points; others, 2 firsts, 2 seconds, 9 thirds,
total 26 points. You seem to be fond of 6’s, Don.”</p>

<p>“What counts what?” asked Wayne.</p>

<p>“First counts 5, second 3, third 1. There are twelve
events and 108 points,” answered Don. “I’ve given Hillton
everything she can win, and one first that is doubtful.
Of course, St. Eustace may be stronger or weaker than I
think. But, pshaw! the whole thing’s just guess work; we
may not score 20 points, or we may possibly get 40; you
can never tell. But Beck wanted a guess at it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you where you can get five points
more,” said Dave. “You’ve credited us with second place
in the hammer throw and St. Eustace with first. You can
give us first and second both.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve just thrown over one hundred and forty-six
feet, and I can better it by two more in a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
days.” And Dave retold his story. Don bit the end of
his pencil thoughtfully; then he referred to a sheet of
figures before him.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right, Dave. By Jove, I am glad!
Trowbridge, of Northern Collegiate, threw one hundred
and forty-eight feet five inches last year; Sumner, of St.
Eustace, one hundred and forty-seven even. If you can
throw two feet better than you did to-day, Dave, we’ll
stand a chance to beat St. Eustace, at least. Give me that
list. There, that makes it—why, it makes St. Eustace and
us each forty-one points!”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s more than a fighting chance.”</p>

<p>“Yes. But what’s the good of figuring on track meetings?
Any one of those other five schools might upset this
whole table of figures.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so. But let’s hope for the best; it
doesn’t cost any more,” answered Dave cheerfully. Don
bundled away his papers, and, with the result of his labors
in hand, went out with Dave on his way to Professor Beck’s
room. Left to himself, Wayne got his books together,
drew a half-finished thesis toward him, and started to work.
Presently he stopped and knit his brows. Then he
chewed the end of his pen as an aid to memory, and at
length went to the bookcase and turned over several volumes,
apparently without finding the information he desired.
At that moment a knock sounded and Carl Gray
entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hello!” cried Wayne. “Say, Gray, when did the
insurrection of Cylon take place?”</p>

<p>“Oh, about a couple of thousand years ago, I guess.”</p>

<p>“But what year was it?”</p>

<p>“Well, let me see; 357 <span class="lcsmcaps">B. C.</span>, wasn’t it? No; that was
the war of the Athenian league. I guess I don’t know,
Gordon.”</p>

<p>“Shucks! I’ll have to go over to the library.”</p>

<p>“Well, wait a minute and I’ll go with you. I brought
these up.” He took a package from his pocket and laid it
on the table; Wayne picked it up, and undoing the paper
covering revealed a pair of new cork grips.</p>

<p>“They’re for you,” said Gray hurriedly. “I hope
you’ll use them when you win the mile at the interscholastic
meet. They’re not very well made; I had to use big stoppers,
and they were sort of coarse grained.”</p>

<p>“Why, they’re simply immense,” said Wayne. He took
one in each hand and gripped his fingers about them. “I’m
awfully much obliged. And of course I’ll use ’em, whether
I win or lose, Gray. But how in the world could you
make ’em?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you just cut the cork out in sections and glue
them over a piece of wood, you know. Then you shape it
with a sharp knife and sort of polish it off with fine sandpaper
or emery. It’s easy enough, and I’m glad you like
them.”</p>

<p>“You bet I do! They’re fine! Thanks, awfully.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gordon, I wish you weren’t so full of thanks; you tire
me to death!” said Gray, trying to mimic Wayne’s manner.
Wayne grinned.</p>

<p>“Now we’re even. Come over to the library with me.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Gray, as they went downstairs, “we’re not
even. And we sha’n’t be for a long time. And that reminds
me.” He pulled a coin out of his pocket and handed
it to Wayne. “I sha’n’t be here a week from Saturday,
you know; we go to Marshall to play St. Eustace.”</p>

<p>“That’s the last of them, isn’t it?” asked Wayne as he
dropped the dollar into his pocket.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the last. And thank you ever so much,
Gordon. Did I tell you last week that I’d been sending
a little money home to my mother ever since I got those
first golf balls to fix? Yes, and I know she’s tickled about
it. You wouldn’t think that a fellow could make money
in school, would you?”</p>

<p>“Some fellows could, and some couldn’t,” answered
Wayne. “Do you get any balls to mend nowadays?”</p>

<p>“Yes, quite often; and a good many clubs. I’ve got so
I can put a new shaft on to a head in fine style.”</p>

<p>“But you must have turned your room into a regular
carpenter shop,” laughed the other.</p>

<p>“No; I use a corner of the carriage room in the stable.
Mr. Vance doesn’t charge me anything for it; he’s awfully
kind. You might come over and see my ‘repair shop’
some day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will, and I’ll bring a club of Don’s that has the
leather hanging by the skin of its teeth; it’s a disgrace to
the study and ought to be fixed.”</p>

<p>They had reached the library, and Wayne went to the
shelves and began a hunt.</p>

<p>“Find one of those epitome things,” suggested Gray.</p>

<p>“Where are they? Oh, I see.” He laid his hand on a
volume, but as he did so his eyes encountered the title of
the one next it. “Ploetz’s Epitome of Universal History,”
he read. “Who was it spoke of that once?” He took the
book down and withdrew to the window. As he did so the
volume opened apparently of its own accord at the three
hundred and fifty-second page.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be switched!” cried Wayne.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” asked his companion, coming toward
him.</p>

<p>“Why—er—nothing at all. I guess I’ll take this
with me.”</p>

<p>Together they passed out, and parted at the corner of
the gymnasium. Wayne hurried on to Turner Hall and
sprang up two flights of stairs.</p>

<p>“I hope Benson’s in,” he said to himself as he knocked
lustily at the door of No. 36. He was, and in a moment
Wayne was crossing the study toward where the occupant
sat by the open window reading something which looked
but little like a text-book.</p>

<p>“Hello, Gordon!” cried Benson. “Glad to see you; sit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
down and be happy.” For reply Wayne opened the library
book and laid it face up on the window seat.</p>

<p>“What’s—” began Benson; then he stopped with a
gasp. On the open pages rested a new two-dollar bill,
folded once. “Did you find it there?” he asked in bewilderment.
Wayne nodded.</p>

<p>“Well!” Benson took the bill and felt of it as though
doubting its genuineness. “I must have slipped it in there
to mark my place when Gray came in that day!”</p>

<p>“You must have,” answered Wayne dryly. Benson
flushed and looked worried.</p>

<p>“By Jove, Gordon, I’m awfully sorry! Such a stupid
thing to do! I remember now that I took the book back
that evening just before supper, and I suppose I didn’t
open it once. Do you think I ought to apologize to
Gray?”</p>

<p>“No, he doesn’t know but that you found it long ago;
you know I told him you had. No, there’s nothing to do
but grab the money and put it somewhere where it won’t get
lost. You see, Benson, I don’t want to be accused of taking
it away with me,” he added unkindly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, Gordon, let up!”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Wayne, “we’ll forget it. I’ll
take the book with me. And, by the way, if you feel that
you’d like to make up to Gray for—for suspecting him,
you know, why, bust a golf club or two and let him mend
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>On the stairs of Bradley Wayne encountered Paddy,
who threw his arms about him and hugged him ecstatically.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! He’s gone! He’s went! He’s departed!”</p>

<p>“Who?” gasped Wayne.</p>

<p>“Gardiner, the great, good, and only Gardiner! He
took the 2.30 for home, and now I can get some peace and
quiet. Honest Injun, Wayne, if he had stayed another
week I should have been a gibbering idiot and gone around
cutting people’s throats with a long, keen blade!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up,” laughed Wayne. “Have you been upstairs?
Is Don there?”</p>

<p>“I have. He is not. Come, let us go to the village
and celebrate at Caper’s on soda water. Let us speed the
parting guest. Gardiner’s all right, Wayne, but, ah, he’s
terrible onaisy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’m supposed to drink soda water,
Paddy, but I’ll go and watch you. Have you seen Dave
lately?”</p>

<p>“No, what’s he been up to?”</p>

<p>“He’s been breaking his own record with the hammer.”</p>

<p>When Paddy heard the facts he was delighted, and
proved it by dancing from side to side of the dusty roadway
until out of breath.</p>

<p>“Old Dave will be pleased to death,” he panted.
“He’s been awfully in the dumps since the handicaps.
My, but I do hope he’ll win out at the interscholastic!”</p>

<p>And then they went on to the village and sought out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
the tiny shop where the enticing sign “Ice Cream Soda”
flanked the doorway. And Paddy drank one of chocolate
flavor in honor of Gardiner’s departure and one of strawberry
in celebration of Dave’s success.</p>

<p>The following Wednesday afternoon Wayne went over
the mile, while Professor Beck and Don and a little group
of fellows looked on and cheered his progress after each
lap. He put his whole mind and energy into the task, and
never altered the hard pace he had set himself up to the
last half of the last quarter, despite the warnings of Don
and the professor, who both timed him.</p>

<p>“He’s going too fast, I’m afraid,” said Don sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“I fear so,” answered the professor. “But maybe he
knows what he can do; he’s improved wonderfully since the
handicaps.”</p>

<p>When the last lap began Wayne let himself out just a
trifle until at the end of the back stretch the little group
was staring in surprise from the watches to the runner.</p>

<p>“He’s done it easily,” cried Don. “And look! Hanged
if he isn’t spurting!”</p>

<p>Down the stretch came Wayne, his head back, his arms
at his side, and running as though he was being paced by
a steam engine. Over the line he dashed and the two
watches stopped.</p>

<p>“Five minutes eight and a fifth seconds!” cried Don.</p>

<p>“Five minutes eight and a fifth seconds!” echoed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the professor. The crowd clapped as Wayne trotted back,
panting and flushed but evidently unwearied; and Don
patted him joyfully on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Eight and a fifth, Wayne!” he cried. Wayne looked
for confirmation to the professor, who nodded as he dropped
his watch back into his pocket.</p>

<p>“That will do for to-day, Gordon. Report at training
table in the morning,” he said.</p>

<p>Nine days later the track team, together with Professor
Beck and two graduate coaches, assembled after supper in
the gymnasium, were cheered individually and collectively
by their schoolmates, and were conveyed to the station,
where they embarked on the Pacific Express for the up-State
city which was on the morrow to be the scene of the
interscholastic meeting.</p>

<p>And with them went the hopes of Hillton.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>THE INTERSCHOLASTIC MEET</small></h2>


<p>It had rained in the night, and the young grass was
intensely green in the great oval; the quarter mile of cinder
track, fresh from the rollers, was smooth, firm, and springy,
and the newly turned mold before the vaulting standard
gave forth a pleasant odor beneath the rakes. The lime
marks and circles shone glaring white in the afternoon sunlight
and the bright colors of bonnet and dress and wrap
vied in brilliancy with the banners of the contesting schools—with
the deep blue of St. Eustace, the brown of Warrenton,
the blue and white of Northern Collegiate, the maroon
of Maddurn Hall, the green of Shrewsburg, the purple
and white of Thracia Polytechnic, and the crimson of
Hillton.</p>

<p>The blue and white was most in evidence, for the Northern
Collegiate students were on home ground, while the
others were visitors from far and near. The collegiate band
was discoursing brazen two steps, the circling grand stands
were buzzing with talk and laughter, the officials were
hurrying, scurrying, hither and thither, and from near by,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
behind the unlovely high board fences, the electric cars
droned and clanged as they drew up to the entrance and
discharged their loads. And overhead arched a softly blue
May sky just flecked with tiny wads of cottonlike clouds.
Northern Collegiate might have drawn a fair augury from
that sky.</p>

<p>The clerk of the course was busy placing the runners
for the first trial heat of the one-hundred-yard dash. Presently
the long line was crouching on the mark, the pistol
sounded, and the interscholastic meeting had begun. Other
trial heats followed until the contestants for the sprints and
the hurdles were sifted down to a few for each event.
Meanwhile the broad jumpers were busy at the standard,
and in the oval a little group were preparing for the shot
putting.</p>

<p>The mile run was down on the card as the last event,
and Wayne, who was entered for that only, looked on from
the far side of the field, one of a group of many, in front of
the dressing room. Paddy, who had in some way smuggled
himself inside the ropes, sat beside him.</p>

<p>“We can’t see very much from here,” observed Paddy.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go across, then?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that marshal will ask me embarrassing
questions; he’s been glaring at me suspiciously for the last
ten minutes. They’re fixing the low hurdles over there;
hope Don will win. He looked worried a while ago, I
thought.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“I reckon he’s all right,” answered Wayne. “He was
put out about Gaffney.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Gaff?”</p>

<p>“Ankles lame or sore or something. Don was afraid
he wouldn’t be able to jump much. But I guess he’s doing
well enough.”</p>

<p>“They’re on the mark; three of them! Don and Perkins,
and a St. Eustace chap.”</p>

<p>“Varian, I reckon. Don said he’d get second or third
at least.”</p>

<p>“There they go!” The report of the pistol floated
across the field to where the boys were sitting. “Don’s
taken the lead already! Go it, old fellow!”</p>

<p>And Don, though he couldn’t possibly hear Paddy’s
command, nevertheless “went it” so well that at the sixth
hurdle he was ten yards to the good, with Perkins close
behind him. The white forms flashed up and down in the
sunlight for a moment longer; then the race was over, and
Hillton had begun the day bravely by capturing a first and
a second, scoring eight points to St. Eustace’s one.</p>

<p>But Fortune’s face is ever turning, and in the next
event, the one-hundred-yard dash, St. Eustace took first
place and Hillton failed to score, the rest of the points going
to Northern Collegiate’s speedy sprinters. But in the four
hundred and forty yards Hillton took both first and second
again, increasing her lead by eight more units and leaving
her dreaded rival far behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>And so it went, Dame Fortune smiling and frowning
alternately on the wearers of the crimson, until the sun had
begun to drop back of the city roofs. Of the track events
Hillton had now won three firsts, two seconds, and one
third; St. Eustace, two firsts and three thirds; and the two
schools had divided five points in the half-mile run, Whitehead
having finished side by side with Brown, of St. Eustace,
after a spurt down the cinders that brought the grand
stand cheering to its feet.</p>

<p>Don had won the high hurdles in magnificent style from
a Polytechnic youth by a short yard, a St. Eustace hurdler
securing third place. Warrenton and St. Eustace had
fought desperately for the tape in the two-hundred-and-twenty-yard
dash, and the latter had gained a close decision,
Hillton taking third place. Hillton had done well in the
hurdles, fairly so in the middle distances, and poorly in the
dashes; St. Eustace had excelled in the dashes and had
failed to win better than third place in the hurdles.</p>

<p>The field events had sprung some surprises on the wearers
of the crimson. The pole vault had netted them nothing,
the deep blue having taken eight points and Northern
Collegiate one.</p>

<p>Gaffney’s weak ankle had interfered to some extent
with his performance in the broad jump, and his best try,
twenty-one feet eight inches and a half, only secured three
points for his school, St. Eustace scoring first place. Again,
in the high jump, the latter academy had excelled and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
both first and second places had gone to her clever youngsters.</p>

<p>In the shot putting both St. Eustace and Hillton had
failed signally, although the latter had managed to capture
third place, Northern Collegiate, in the person of a big,
broad-shouldered youth, easily winning the event and
breaking the only record of the meeting, with a put of
forty-seven feet six inches. And so, with the hammer throw
still to be decided, and the mile yet to be run, the scores
stood:</p>

<ul>
<li>St. Eustace, 36½;</li>
<li>Hillton, 29½;</li>
<li>Northern Collegiate, 11;</li>
<li>Scattering, 14.</li>
</ul>

<p>But the hopes of the Hillton supporters were bright,
for St. Eustace had already dropped out of the hammer
throw, and only Trowbridge, of Northern Collegiate, and
Dave and Hardy had qualified for the finals; Trowbridge
with a throw of one hundred and forty-three feet, Dave
with one of one hundred and forty-two feet eight inches,
and Hardy with one of one hundred and forty feet four
inches. And now Trowbridge had the ball and wire for his
final tries.</p>

<p>Victory seemed already his, and his freckled face held
an expression of radiant confidence. The previous competitors,
together with the judges and the scorer and a few
privileged college men, watched with interest as he swung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the weight around with long arms and sent it flying across
the turf. Then the tape was moved over, and in a moment
the distance was announced:</p>

<p>“Hundred and forty-six feet three inches.”</p>

<p>Trowbridge shrugged his shoulders as he took the hammer
for the next attempt and put more speed into the
swing. But he used his feet poorly and the figures dropped
back to three inches under one hundred and forty-five feet.
A shade of uneasiness darkened the confident face, and
Trowbridge set his lips tightly as he raised the weight.
Then the long arms whirled, the body spun around, and the
hammer whizzed through the air. The tape was laid to the
ground.</p>

<p>“Hundred and forty-seven feet nine inches,” said a
judge.</p>

<p>Trowbridge stepped from the ring with a scowl, and
Dave took his place. As the Hillton lad gripped his hammer
his eyes fell on Paddy, who had joined the little throng,
his desire to witness Dave’s work having overcome his
fear of the marshal. Paddy grinned encouragement, and
Dave, with a lurking smile on his serious countenance, responded
with a portentous wink. Then the hammer went
up, swung around in its widening circle, and flew away.</p>

<p>“Hundred and forty-three feet three inches.”</p>

<p>Once more, and again the tape and the careful measurement.</p>

<p>“Hundred and forty-eight feet five inches.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>A ripple of surprise and applause went through the
audience. Trowbridge looked sad. Paddy executed a
quiet dance at the edge of the throng. Back came the
hammer. Dave gripped it with an air of determination,
and placed his feet with greater care than before. Up
went the weight, around spun the boy like a dervish, once,
twice, thrice; there was a sudden quick stiffening of the
muscles, a set to the shoulders, and the twelve pounds of
iron sped away at a tangent and ripped the sod at a point
farther from the circle than any preceding throw.</p>

<p>“One hundred and forty-nine feet one inch,” announced
the judges. Dave had won first place for Hillton.</p>

<p>He stepped out, dragging his beloved hammer after
him, with a face that strove hard to hide his happiness.
Hardy clapped him on the back as he passed to join Paddy,
and the latter beamed upon him like the Cheshire cat.
Hardy went in, glad of Dave’s victory over Trowbridge,
but hoping for a victory, in turn, over Dave. But that was
not to be. His first throw was a sorry attempt; his second
scarcely better. But at the third try he put his whole soul
into the task and his whole weight behind the flying ball,
and when the judges stepped back they announced:</p>

<p>“One hundred and forty-eight feet eleven inches.”</p>

<p>“Eight points to Hillton!” cried some one, and several
boys clapped loudly. Then the group broke up, Dave,
Hardy, and Paddy mingling with the crowd that flowed
across toward the dressing room, joy in their hearts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ready for the mile!” called a voice, and in answer a
squad of boys trotted across the field toward the starting
point. Wayne and Whitehead were in the van and Paddy
waved to them as they passed.</p>

<p>“Go in and win, Old Virginia!” And Wayne nodded
smilingly, and hoped that his face wasn’t quite as white as
it felt. Professor Beck, Don, and two Hillton coaches were
waiting, and Don helped him off with his coat, and trotted
along beside him while he limbered up.</p>

<p>“Wayne, this is what you’ve got to do,” he whispered.
“Get to the front as soon as you can and look for Sturgis.
If he’s ahead, stay with him no matter what pace he sets.
If he’s behind, wait for him. Pay no attention to any
others. It doesn’t matter who wins as long as St. Eustace
doesn’t get a place. Sturgis is their only man that we need
fear; so freeze to him, and don’t let him get away from
you. Look out for tricks, though, for St. Eustace is going
to try them, I’m sure. If she can get first or second men
in she’ll have us beaten; if she can win third place she’ll
tie us. Win if you can, but, whatever happens, <em>down
Sturgis</em>!”</p>

<p>“Hurry up, milers!” called the clerk of the course.
Don gave Wayne an affectionate clap on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Go in, old man,” he whispered, “and remember Hillton
every minute!”</p>

<p>There were twelve entries for the mile. St. Eustace,
beside her crack long-distance runner Sturgis, had entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
House and Gould, both men to be feared. Hillton was represented
by Wayne and Whitehead, both new men and
inexperienced; Hillton’s chances were not considered very
good by the other schools. Northern Collegiate and
Shrewsburg had each entered two runners, and the other
schools were represented by one man apiece. Northern
Collegiate was doing a deal of talking about a youth named
Pope, of whom little was known to the other schools, and
who was spoken of as a “dark horse” that stood a fair
chance of winning. Wayne found himself placed between
Pope, who turned out to be a heavily-built fellow of apparently
nineteen, and a pale and nervous boy much younger
in years, whose brown ribbon bore in gold letters the emblem
“W. A. A. A.” Gould had the place next to the
inner edge of the track, and Sturgis and Whitehead were
together near the outer edge.</p>

<p>The spectators had begun to leave the grounds and the
stands already presented little barren patches. The shadow
of the small building wherein was the dressing room
stretched far across the oval, and the sun was fast sinking
behind the forest of roofs and chimneys in the west. Contestants
in previous events were dressed and stood about
the turf to watch the last and deciding struggle for the
championship of the year.</p>

<p>Pope was restively digging his toes into the path while
the penalties for false starting were being explained with
much vehemence by the starter. The Warrenton runner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
on Wayne’s left was working his arms back and forth as
though he was going to win the race on his hands and
feared his elbows would get stiff. Wayne himself was undeniably
nervous. It was his first appearance in a public
contest, barring the cross-country run at Hillton the preceding
autumn, and the thought of what failure would mean
was beginning to take the starch out of him. But nervousness
was the one thing that had been prohibited above all
others; and so he tried to forget about the possibilities of
failure and had begun to wonder, without much interest
in the problem, how many men it required to keep the
grass cut on the big oval when the starter’s voice brought
his thoughts back at a leap.</p>

<p>“<em>On your mark!</em>”</p>

<p>Pope growled something to him about dull spikes and
loose tracks, but Wayne made no answer. He was looking
straight ahead down the broad path, his thoughts in a
tumult.</p>

<p>“<em>Set!</em>”</p>

<p>Twelve bodies leaned farther forward and there was a
perceptible sound of intaking breath up and down the line.
Then, when it seemed to many that another moment of suspense
would make them shout or dance or do something else
equally ridiculous, <em>bang!</em> went the pistol, and the line
leaped forward and broke into fragments as the runners
sped away.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>WON AT THE FINISH</small></h2>


<p>Wayne had made a good beginning; he was already,
ere the timers’ watches had ticked thrice, well in toward
the left of the track and one of the first five men. He
looked for Sturgis and found that dreaded youth close beside
him. Before them were Pope, a Maddurn Hall boy,
and the pale-faced youngster who had stood beside Wayne.
Pope was making the pace, a rather fast one it seemed,
and was running with a great expenditure of strength.
Sturgis kept beside Wayne until the turn; then, as the
latter took the inside edge, he fell in behind. Wayne
wished devoutly that he would go ahead. He didn’t like
the pace, which was too fast for the first quarter of a mile
race, and he would have preferred to have been farther in
the rear. When the back stretch began Wayne therefore
decreased his speed a little. It had the desired effect. In
a few seconds Sturgis was beside him again; in a few more
he was a pace or two ahead. Wayne could not but admire
the St. Eustace boy’s running. He kept well up on his toes,
his thighs moved seemingly of their own volition, and his
stride was all ease and swing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>At the next turn Sturgis ran close to the inner edge of
the track and Wayne dropped a pace or two farther back
and cast a fleeting glance over his shoulder. The balance
of the contestants were strung pretty well down the back
stretch, but Whitehead was about midway between first
man and last. Pope had diminished his pace a little and
the Warrenton boy seemed anxious to take his place. Then
the group about the start was reached and cheers for the
leader from the Collegiate contingent rent the air; then
one after another of the runners received his applause and
went by. Wayne caught a momentary glimpse of Paddy
and Don beside the track as he began the second quarter.</p>

<p>Save that the last of the runners began to straggle a
little, there was no change in the second quarter. Wayne
held his place just behind Sturgis and ran on with a steady,
easy stride. Again the start was reached and the race was
half run.</p>

<p>“Time enough, Pope!” called a Collegiate coach, and
at the same moment Wayne saw from the corner of his
eye a runner draw slowly up beside him, hang there a
second, and pass ahead. His colors proclaimed him a Collegiate
runner and Wayne watched him with interest. By
the time the turn was reached he was slightly behind the
Warrenton boy, who was still at second place. Then Pope
swerved aside, Warrenton was in the lead, with the second
Collegiate runner close behind, and Pope had dropped back
to a position just ahead of Sturgis. And now Sturgis, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
appeared desirous of falling back, for his pace diminished
and the distance between him and the leader grew. But
Wayne refused the invitation to pass and suited his speed
to that of the wearer of the blue.</p>

<p>Half of the third quarter had been left behind when
Wayne heard steps and the sound of breathing beside him
again, and in another moment Gould had spurted by and
Wayne was obliged to swerve slightly in order to avoid
colliding with Sturgis, who upon the appearance of Gould
had again lessened his speed. Mindful of his orders, but
full of doubt, Wayne in turn fell back and Gould passed
on and took the inner side behind Pope. Sturgis was still
back of Wayne, and the latter slowed up yet more, striving
to secure again a position behind the St. Eustace’s crack.
But Sturgis refused to take the lead. The Maddurn Hall
boy was dropping back fast, and at the middle of the turn
Warrenton still led, followed in order by the two Northern
Collegiate runners, Gould, Wayne, and Sturgis. As the
home stretch began Gould drew ahead, running superbly,
and as the line was crossed he was in the lead by a dozen
yards or so, and St. Eustace cheers filled the air.</p>

<p>Then the last quarter began and found Wayne in perplexity.
Gould was every instant increasing his lead,
although Pope and his fellow-runner had taken up the
chase. Warrenton was clearly out of it, and ere the first
turn was reached Gould, the two Northern Collegiate runners,
and Wayne were speeding along in the order named.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Wayne was troubled. He asked himself whether, orders
or no orders, he should stay back there when Gould was
already thirty yards or more ahead of him and still spurting.
Don and the others had quite evidently overestimated
Sturgis’s importance and underestimated Gould’s. And if
something was not done and done speedily the race was
already St. Eustace’s. As though to aid him in his decision,
Sturgis began to lag until, although Wayne could not see
him, he appeared to that anxious youth to be practically
out of the running.</p>

<p>“Here goes!” said Wayne to himself.</p>

<p>They were on the turn now and he left his place beside
the inner edge and passed Pope and was soon alongside the
other Collegiate runner. The latter gave him a hard race,
but ere the back stretch was reached had yielded second
place, and Wayne dashed on in what seemed a hopeless
effort to reach Gould.</p>

<p>Back at the finish Don pulled his cap over his face and
groaned.</p>

<p>“It’s all up; Wayne has fallen into the trap!” One
of the Hillton coaches said something under his breath,
and Professor Beck frowned grimly.</p>

<p>“But you told him?” asked the coach. “He had his
orders?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Don. “But you can see! And I
suppose he’s not altogether to blame; it was so smoothly
done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>The coach ground the turf under his heel. Across the
oval, Gould had almost reached the last turn, Wayne was
some twenty yards behind him, still running like a streak,
and back of Wayne sped Sturgis, easily, gracefully, taking
his pace from the Hillton runner and covering the
ground without overexertion or worry. Behind him again
streamed the rest, Whitehead running side by side with
Pope and a Shrewsburg chap vainly trying to pass them.
But Gould’s work was done, and at the beginning of the
turn he slowed up, weary and panting, and soon Wayne had
passed him, tuckered but happy.</p>

<p>There comes a moment in every long-distance race
when the last ounce of strength and endurance and the last
breath seems to have been expended; after that the runner
simply performs the impossible. Wayne had reached that
moment. His legs ached, his breath tore itself from his
lungs, and it seemed that further effort was out of the question.
But the finish line was almost in sight, and so he
gripped his moist fingers tighter about the corks and
hugged the edge of the cinders. At least, he told himself,
St. Eustace was beaten!</p>

<p>And then he heard the soft <em>pat</em>, <em>pat</em>, <em>pat</em>, of steps behind
him, and at the same instant cries of “St. Eustace!
St. Eustace!” Not daring to look behind, he struggled
on in an agony of suspense until the turn was left and
the broad path stretched clear and straight before him
to the finish, where, strange and distorted to his strained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
eyes, forms leaped and gesticulated beside the track. Then
the pursuer drew alongside and Wayne caught the gleam
of deep blue ribbon, and could have shouted aloud in rage
and mortification had there been breath enough in his
body. In a flash he saw it all: Gould’s deceptive spurt, his
own blind idiotic credulity, and Sturgis’s pursuit, with him
to make the pace. St. Eustace had tricked him finely!
For an instant the thought of yielding presented itself,
but only to be routed in the next breath by a resolve to
keep on, to contest the race to the very end, to run until he
dropped.</p>

<p>Sturgis was now a yard in the lead, running well, but
he was by no means fresh nor unwearied. Wayne gritted
his teeth, gulped down a sob, and put every muscle and
nerve to the test. He remembered a remark of Don’s:
“When you are ready to drop, just think that the other
man is worse off, and keep going.”</p>

<p>“He is, he is!” Wayne told himself. “He’s done up!
I can win! I <em>will</em> win!”</p>

<p>The tape was close before them now. Sturgis was
plainly in distress, for he, too, had made a hard race. The
crowd at the finish was shrieking unintelligible things.
Inch by inch the red ribbon was winning its place beside
the blue. Ten yards from the judges Wayne was even
with Sturgis; five yards more and he had gained, but
scarcely enough to be noticed by the throng.</p>

<p>“Hillton’s race! Come on, Gordon, <em>come on</em>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“St. Eustace wins! St. Eustace! St. Eustace!”</p>

<p>Sturgis threw his head back and strove to draw away,
but Wayne, with unseeing eyes, almost reeling, lifted his
arms weakly, called upon the last gasp of breath in his
body, and hurled himself forward in a final despairing
effort. And then the little white tape was gone and he lay
in a tumbled heap upon the path.</p>

<p>“Hillton first,” announced the judges.</p>

<p>“Four minutes fifty-eight and four fifths,” said the timekeepers.</p>

<p>Hillton had won the interscholastic.</p>

<p>The victors sat at banquet. To be sure, as regarded
variety of viand and culinary excellence it left much to
desire; in fact it was, I believe, simply called “Dinner” on
the <i>menu</i> card. But it answered all the purposes of a
Roman feast. Victory presided, Happiness and Merriment
were the guests of honor, and Hunger waited at table.
Professor Beck was there, and one of the coaches, and Don,
and Wayne, and Whitehead, and Dave, and Gaffney, and
Perkins, and Connor, and Hardy, and Kendall, and several
others; and every one talked as much as he could and ate
indiscriminately of all on the board, and was wonderfully,
radiantly joyful. The hotel management had given them
a little room to themselves; fortunately for the peace of the
other guests, for it was necessary to cheer loudly and often.</p>

<p>The events of the day were discussed from start to finish
and the official summary of the meeting was passed from
hand to hand around the board and the figures eagerly
scanned.</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar!” muttered Don as he looked it over;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
“to think that two points moved from the first column to

Sturgis——”</p>

<p>“It was close,” said Wayne, as he handed the summary
on to Connor, who sat at his right. “And,” he added in a
low voice, “when I think how nearly I lost the thing for
you, Don, I feel like kicking myself back to Hillton.”</p>

<p>At that moment the door was burst open and Paddy’s
flushed and exultant face peered in.</p>

<p>“Don’t want to bother you, fellows,” he cried, “but
thought you’d like to hear the news. We won at Marshall;
Hillton 4, St. Eustace 0!” He shied an evening paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
across the room at Dave and disappeared again. As the
door closed Professor Beck sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Now, boys, three times three for the nine, and every
one yell!” And every one did yell. And then the paper
was passed around and the brief account of the baseball
game was read and reread.</p>

<p>“By Jove,” cried Don, “your friend Gray’s gone and
done it again!”</p>

<p>“Done what?” asked Wayne.</p>

<p>“Made a home run; and in the last inning, too! What
do you think of that?”</p>

<p>Whereupon Wayne tried to snatch the paper from Don,
and only succeeded in upsetting the contents of the latter’s
tumbler into Professor Beck’s salad.</p>

<p>But there is a limit even to the capacity of a triumphant
track team, and after a while, when Professor Beck
and the coach had made short, earnest speeches, had been
cheered to the echo, and had left the room, Don made himself
heard and announced that nominations for the captaincy
of the team for the ensuing year were in order. Instantly
Gaffney and Dave were on their feet, and the
former was recognized.</p>

<p>“I don’t see any use in fussing with nominations and
such stuff; we’ve all eaten too much. I move you that
Donald Cunningham be re-elected by acclamation and that
we all go home.”</p>

<p>Cheering and laughter, cries of “Yes, yes, Cunningham!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and “Second the motion!” arose; and Don got
up and waited a chance to speak. When the uproar had
died down for a moment he said:</p>

<p>“I thank you, fellows, for the nomination, but I can
not——”</p>

<p>“Don, Don, Donald C.!” chanted Wayne, and Dave
took up the refrain, and in a moment the room was again
a pandemonium.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Don, Don, Donald C.,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">One big captain he!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">improvised Wayne, and the rest caught eagerly at the
doggerel and chanted it lustily to the accompaniment of
weird music produced by knives and tumblers. Don held
up a hand appealingly.</p>

<p>“Fellows, please come to order!” he cried. And when
the tumult had subsided he went on: “I can’t accept the
nomination, although I feel—recognize——”</p>

<p>“Hear! hear!” bawled Dave.</p>

<p>“Although I appreciate the honor. I thank you all. I
am glad that we won to-day and hope that we will repeat
the victory next year. I will do my best to keep my place
on the team, but I must refuse the captaincy.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” cried his hearers.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel that I can spare the time from my lessons
next year, and I hope you will excuse me and elect some
one to take my place. If I may be allowed to nominate
a candidate——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Cries of “Yes, yes! Go ahead!”</p>

<p>“I nominate for captain Wayne Gordon.”</p>

<p>A chorus of applause broke out. Wayne stared in bewilderment
about the board. “Gordon! Gordon!” cried
several; and Whitehead and Dave seconded the nomination
in unison.</p>

<p>“Are there any other nominations?” asked Don.</p>

<p>Wayne leaped to his feet. “I don’t quite know whether
this is a joke or not.” He frowned inquiringly at Don.</p>

<p>Don smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Speech!” called some one.</p>

<p>“But if it isn’t a joke, it’s—it’s silly rot. I am no more
fit to be captain than I am to—to be principal.”</p>

<p>“Sit down,” shouted Dave, “you’re out of order!”
But Wayne paid no attention; instead he looked quite serious
as he continued.</p>

<p>“To prove what I say, fellows, I’m going to make a
confession. You—you ought to know about it. I won the
mile race to-day——”</p>

<p>“You bet you did!” said some one. “You’re all
right!”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t deserve it. I came near losing it by—by
my pigheadedness. I don’t deserve any credit; fact is, I
ought to be put off the team.”</p>

<p>The fellows had quieted down and were listening in surprise
and curiosity. Don put up a hand and tried to pull
him back into his seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“Shut up, Wayne,” he pleaded in a whisper.</p>

<p>“To-day,” continued Wayne, “I was told to get behind
Sturgis and to hang to him to the end of the race. Well,
I didn’t; I thought I knew more than the coaches, and Professor
Beck and the captain, and every one. And when
St. Eustace put up a game by sending Gould ahead as
though he was going to win the race, I just let instructions
go and went after him. You all know how nearly Sturgis
came to winning——”</p>

<p>“A miss is as good as a mile,” said Connor.</p>

<p>“And if he had won St. Eustace would have got the
championship, and it would have been all due to my foolishness.
I haven’t felt right about it since you fellows were
so kind and cheered me, and—and all; and I’ve wanted to
tell you the truth, and I have; and I’m glad you gave me
the chance. And I thank you for the nomination, but
couldn’t take it even if you still wanted me to.”</p>

<p>Wayne sat down, and three fellows were instantly on
their feet. Don recognized Whitehead.</p>

<p>“Look here, fellows,” he said, speaking quickly and
vehemently, “I don’t deny that Gordon made a mistake,
but I want to tell you that he wasn’t to blame. The trick
would have deceived any fellow that wasn’t experienced;
if it had been me instead of Gordon, I would have fallen
into the trap just as he did, and I’m not sure that I’d been
so ready to own up and tell the truth about it, either.
Gordon made a mistake, but he ran the finest sort of a race;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
he’s got lots of pluck and lots of go, and we all like him;
and I think he will make a good captain, if Cunningham
won’t accept re-election; and I move that we prove to him
that we don’t think any less of him for his mistake by asking
him to accept the nomination.”</p>

<p>“Good! Seconded!” was heard on all sides, and in a
moment the motion had carried unanimously. Wayne was
very busy making bread pills, his eyes on the table cloth.</p>

<p>“Silence gives assent,” said Don gayly. “Are there
any other nominations?” None spoke. “I move that
the nominations be closed,” said Dave. “I second that
motion,” said Whitehead. “And I move that the election
be—be— Oh, I mean let’s go ahead and elect Gordon,”
concluded Whitehead amid a laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t see the use of balloting,” replied Don,
“and as the proceedings have been out of order all evening
I guess we might as well continue to have them so. Suppose
we take a rising vote?”</p>

<p>“Yes! Rising vote! Go ahead!”</p>

<p>“Fellows, all those in favor of the election of Wayne
Gordon to the captaincy of the track team for the ensuing
year will so signify by rising.”</p>

<p>Every fellow save Wayne was on his feet.</p>

<p>“Gordon is elected,” said Don.</p>

<p>“Unanimously!” cried Perkins.</p>

<p>“Fellows,” continued the ex-captain, “I call for three
cheers for Gordon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>And they were given with a will. Wayne, rather pale
and uncomfortable, arose.</p>

<p>“Speech! speech!” laughed a number. Wayne cleared
his throat, opened his mouth, shut it again, looked appealingly
at Don, and sank back into his chair. But the
team was not satisfied, and renewed calls for a speech
arose.</p>

<p>“Speak your piece, Wayne!” called Dave, and Wayne
got up again and started bravely.</p>

<p>“I can’t make a speech. But I thank you for what
you’ve done, fellows. I’m afraid you’ve made a mistake
in electing me; I don’t know much about athletics, but I’ll
learn; perhaps Don here will help me.”</p>

<p>“All I can,” answered that youth readily.</p>

<p>“I’ve learned a good bit since I came to Hillton, and I
reckon I can learn more. I’ve learned that it’s a mighty
good thing to do as you’re told, and to obey authority, and
not to think that you know everything, because you don’t;
at least, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“You know how to run!” cried Kendall, and the remark
was laughingly applauded.</p>

<p>“As I said,” continued Wayne, “I’m afraid you fellows
have made a mistake, but—but I’ll try to prove that
you haven’t. I hope every one of you will help me and try
to excuse any blunders I may make; for I’m bound to make
lots; I’m not Donald Cunningham, you know.”</p>

<p>A murmur of applause arose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“I never can be as good a captain as he has been——”</p>

<p>The murmur grew into a cheer, and it was fully a minute
ere Wayne could continue.</p>

<p>“And I don’t expect to. But”—he looked earnestly
around the circle of flushed and happy faces—“but I’ll
try my level best, fellows, and I’ll do all I know how for
you and—and for the honor of the school!”</p>

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
